This is not as bad as it sounds, we're not gone all corporate!

The WunderWay is all about doing thing right, about trying to achieve great results and making sure that we're operating effectively and efficiently. There are a lot of people across WunderKraut and we're based in many different locations. Each year we'll carry out internal audits and management reviews to check that we're doing things right and that the WunderWay is the right way.

If a management review or audit identifies any issues relating to the WunderWay then each of these should be raised as an issue in GitHub.

###Management Reviews

Management Reviews will look at the effectiveness of the QMS. They look at the outputs (sprint reviews, bug reports, metrics, skills matrix) to check that these are providing us with the information we need to assess how well we're doing against our objectives.

Internal Audits will look at projects, onboarding and other aspects of our daily lives to make sure we're implementing the WunderWay properly. 

If the WW has not been implemented properly then we'll look at the reasons behind that and look at ways to improve the implementation in future.

### Internal Audit

The Internal Audits and Management Reviews are carried out each year by those responsible for the WunderWay. See [Roles and Responsibilities] (/about-this-site/quality-management-system/)
