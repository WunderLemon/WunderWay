Every day there is a daily call, hangout or meeting (timeboxed to 15 minutes) during which time each member of The Team discusses:

“Yesterday I...”
“Today I will...”
“My blockers are...”

This is an opportunity to report progress, report what is planned and to raise any issues.

Each member of the team takes their turn. Other people can attend the meeting but only the team should participate. It's important to maintain this rule in order to keep to the 15 minute timebox. If there are issues that need further discussion then they should be covered in a separate call or meeting.

The Scrum Master (SM) attends the meeting to coach the team through running it, but the team are not reporting to the SM, or any stakeholders who are on the call - they are reporting to each other. No one is in charge of running the call properly, everyone is in charge of running the call properly - the scrum master is just there to help.

## Daily Standup Checklist:

* The meeting starts promptly on time at the same time every day, in the same place.
* The attendees are the delivery team and the Scrum Master (SM).
* The SM announces any guests and reminds them they can listen but not speak, in order to keep the meeting on schedule.
* Randomly the SM selects each member of the team to answer the following questions:
*  - Yesterday I worked on...
*  - Today I will work on...
*  - My blockers/problems/worries are...
* Once all members of the team have run through their scrum notes the SM runs through all of the open risks, issues and dependencies.
* If any blockers are raised, the team identifies who will be required to address them and arranges that they’ll be picked up after the scrum.
* If there are any meetings or any advisories for that day, announce them now.
* Thank everyone for attending and announce the date and time of the next meeting.
* The meeting should finish no later than 15 minutes after starting.
* We don't keep a record of daily standups
