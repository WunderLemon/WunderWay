Our larger projects go through a number of phases necessary to take the project the early stages of requirements gathering through prototyping, releasing test versions and on to live.

##Discovery

This is the first phase of the project in which we delve deeper into the requirements that the client has set out. We'll look at the current ways of working and we'll identify ways in which we can improve efficiency, effectiveness and value through process improvement and technology. The output from the discovery phase is a documented and agreed set of deliverables for the project.

##Alpha

Larger projects often need to prototype before heading too far down the track. Prototypes provide a quick way of testing a potential solution (or part of a solution) to prove whether or not it is right for the project. The output from the alpha phase is confirmation of any technical or design decisions that the project had to make before development could proceed.

##Beta

A project moves into the beta phase once it begins to deliver the requirements. This stage of the project is about sprinting, delivering in increments, continually testing, reviewing and tweaking what is required and what is delivered. It's in this phase that we'll begin to introduce users to what we're developing in order to get early feedback.

##Live

A project can go live before its complete. Often we'll achieve an MVP - minimum viable product - that is *enough* for live but we'll continue to develop and add on more features as required.
