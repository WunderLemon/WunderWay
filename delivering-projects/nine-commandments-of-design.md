title: Nine Commandments of Design
---

##1. Design is a team effort

In the end, after all the hard work we’ll end up usually with one product, one usable, functional website. All the decisions that the whole team (including the client) has made during the process will end up being part of that product. Everybody is part of the team for a reason. Nobody could do it alone. We all need each other. We all have our parts to play. We are all one team.

##2. Include the whole team from the beginning. Especially in the discovery phase.

The site is being built by the whole team so everyone should have the same info, same motivation and same feeling of togetherness. Only then we can do our best.

##3. Making design decisions is not a democratic process

Even though we’re approaching the process as a team, we should remember that not everybody gets their share of final decisions about design. It would end up being a compromise and that’s quite rarely good for the product. That’s why we have professionals who have experience and knowledge. They have to listen to their team, but in the end designers should own the design decisions.

##4. Design is solving a problem within given constraints. If constraints aren’t visible, they must be discovered.

In the discovery phase we try to find all possible constraints that apply. Requirements define the problem to solve. Without these boundaries no optimal solution can be found. 

##5. Good design takes place within the overlap between user needs, business goals and technological possibilities.

Design is not just what you see and how it works, it’s also about what it does and why it does what it does. Design is about planning and making well considered trade-offs across these three domains. That’s why the whole team is involved.

##6. Make it usable first, useful second, desirable third, and ideally delightful.

We’ll always aim for delight. But there are no shortcuts so we have to prioritise so we can deliver maximum business value in every iteration. What matters the most is the smooth and meaningful experience for users.

##7. Design is iterative 

Each iteration takes the design forward step by step. The process goes beyond the first presentation and the launch. It’s important to design future proof products and to readjust them during the lifetime of a product. 

##8. Design is informed by facts.

Design is not art. Decisions are based on facts but not dictated by facts. We leave room for interpretation of available data to make stronger, more empirically based design decisions.

##9. Good design is communicated well
The design process is effective when everybody in the team, including the customer, knows why every decision is made. Transparency and communication are important parts of the process.

##Conclusion: 

Form is function and we are all in the same team building both of them.
Almost everything we do is a part of design. Form and its features affects function and visa versa. You shouldn't try to separate them because they are not separate things. Just different sides of it. We are all building some aspects of the product and they will end up affecting its functions as well as form. 

##Why?

“But there is one further problem to solve — design itself. Design has been too wasteful for too long. Not in the sense that it has often been focused on producing unnecessary or harmful commodities or addressing problems that didn’t need solving, but design has been wasteful in terms of its core proposition, its essential mode. Design has too often been deployed at the low value end of the product spectrum, putting lipstick on the pig.

In doing this, design has failed to make a case for it’s core value, which is addressing genuinely meaningful, genuinely knotty problems by convincingly articulating and delivering alternative ways of being. Rethinking the pig altogether, rather than worrying about the shade of lipstick it’s wearing.”
