## Initial Requirements, Response and Contracts

The initial contact with the client, whether through a series of meetings or through a formal tender process will result in the production of a proposal or a tender response document.

Not all projects are the same but we still need to maintain records of proposals, project initiation documents, tender responses and contracts. All of these will be stored in the client’s Google Drive “Contracts” and “Technical Documentation” folders.

This early stage, through the gathering of requirements and objectives will help us to establish a clear picture of what the client needs, the values we need to deliver and how we’ll deliver.

Prior to the project initiation the contract is written and is signed by the client. The signing of contracts is done digitally using our [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.net/member/MemberLogin.aspx) account. [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.net/member/MemberLogin.aspx) delivers the contract to a specified email address, collects the signature and stores the signed document. All steps - sent, received, signed - they’re all logged so that we know the status of the contract. Once signed the contract should be downloaded and stored in the Contracts folder for the project.


## Tenders

Writing tender documents is a big commitment on time and resources. Choosing to pursue an unsuitable project is costly and takes resource away from other tasks.

When receiving an invitation to tender (ITT) we make an initial assessment of the tender to determine whether or not we should pursue using our Project Evaluation spreadsheet.

Unless the client dictates the form of the response we use our own proposal template with pre-written and pre-approved content to create the majority of the proposal. This enforces consistency and assures quality. It also reduces the time required to produce the proposal.

When preparing the proposal or attending meetings to discuss the project we record our times in order that we can determine the effects of changes in our approach to these.

Pre-written content is reviewed every six months by our copywriter. Requests for new content are added to the QMS Change Request log.
