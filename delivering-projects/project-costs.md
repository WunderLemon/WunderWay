title: Monitoring Costs & Managing Efficiency
---

Our quality objectives include a focus on efficiency and this includes the cost to win and to run a project.

##Cost to pursue and win business

We record the cost to pursue and win business in our [Cost of Tender spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahb4YZjQwNDgdGlNeVc4djhRVUd0d0lTYjBSTDJJS3c#gid=0). This is later reviewed during the Management Reviews.

##Managing project costs

Staff times for most projects are very predictable and we've recorded them using spreadsheets but this is primarily for reporting and transparency.

**Daily hours**

All staff should record their times via [Harvest](https://mearra.harvestapp.com/time). Simply record your time each day against each project you work on. Usually this is only one project. Harvest produces reports that we use for invoicing.

**Expenses**

Expenses should be submitted by emailing receipts to *uk.finance@wunderroot.com*. If your expense relates to a particular project then explain how much goes to which project so that the costs can be allocated.

**Project Costs & Availability**

For reporting we record the details of sprints, staff, availability and budget vs actual in our [Schedule of costs and availability](https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahb4YZjQwNDgdGYyNGpyZ0pGM3RHN2tOcEFrUnNEUUE#gid=0) spreadsheet. This is stored in the project's *Reviews & Assessments* folder in Google Drive.

It's important that we all record times and costs accurately. This data is used to calculate our own efficiencies, to determine future project costs and for forecasting.
