title: Quality Management System (QMS)
---

A Quality Management System (QMS) is a defined framework for our business to help us implement and maintain quality is all that we do from onboarding new staff through to delivering projects.

In order to compete in a crowded and competitive market we need to stand out from our competitors and deliver what our clients expect - quality and assurance.

Quality is a key part of our overall Professional Services model that we’ll be implementing during 2013-2015. This model will incorporate the management specialities of Agile, Quality, Risk, Data Security and Continuity to create a very thorough and professional service that will be applied to the entire business, the staff and our customers.

The QMS describes our processes and how we do things but is open to change and continued improvement. Staff from all areas of the business are encouraged to participate in its improvement, however small. The QMS and what it outputs are reviewed at regular intervals to monitor its adoption, implementation and effectiveness. 

A key focus of ISO 9001:2008 is on non-conformities (bugs) and preventive actions (implementing fixes and ways to prevent bugs occuring). The Agile approach to projects means that we’re constantly reviewing what we do, implementing improvements and all deliveries are subject to thorough testing. This helps us capture non-conformities and helps us identify ways to prevent further non-conformities, using what we learn to continually improve.

## Scope

The scope of our QMS which is displayed on our ISO 9001:2008 certificate is described as:

“WunderRoot is a professional services agency for the Web providing consulting, design, development, hosting, training and support on Drupal”

## Quality Objectives

The quality objectives that we define for ourselves are what underpin our Quality Management System. 

The Quality Objectives are derived from the overall <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/document/d/1Ay8lLztddA6PnMlAb35sB0kcLFwQhsyPmwTMuSoPQDg/edit#heading=h.is55ytprmk06">WR Business Objectives</a>.

### Professional Services

Our primary objective is to provide professional services to our customers. In order to do this we need to focus on several sub-objectives:

#### Development and Provision of Quality Products

Goals & Measurements:
<ul>
	<li>100% sign-off of sprints at first attempt</li>
	<li>80% accuracy in sprint estimates</li>
	<li>Maximum of 4 major product non-conformities in client testing</li>
</ul>

The quality of the products that we produce must be consistently high and must be fit for the purpose for which they are intended. The quality of our products must be reviewed regularly by ourselves and our customers and suggested improvements must be easily recorded, reviewed and implemented where necessary.

We must maintain quality in everything that we do including the service we provide and the products we build. 

<i>The quality of the products that we produce will be measured by the satisfaction of the client at the end of each sprint (usability and bug count). Sign-off of a sprint is acceptance of the quality delivered. Sprint estimation accuracy provides a clear indication of what is possible within the remaining sprints and allows for more accurate planning.</i>

#### The Provision of a Quality Service

Goals & Measurements:
<ul>
	<li>100% sign-off of all sprints at first attempt</li>
	<li>100% sign-off of overall project at first attempt</li>
</ul>

The quality of the services that we provide must be consistently high, must provide assurances to our customers and must be constantly improved as we learn. The quality of our services must be reviewed regularly by ourselves and our customers and suggested improvements must be easily recorded, reviewed and implemented where necessary.

<i>The satisfaction of customers is recorded at the end of every sprint and at the end of every project. Sign-off of a sprint is acceptance of the quality delivered.</i>

#### Managing Risk

Goals & Measurements:
<ul>
	<li>The maintenance and management of risk logs for all projects</li>
	<li>The maintenance and management of a risk log for the business</li>
	<li>Regular reporting of risks in steering group meetings</li>
</ul>

Risk is inherent in everything that we do. We must seek to identify and manage risks throughout all our business. Managing risk, and showing that we’re managing risk provides assurances to our customers and staff that we’re in control and are prepared. Risks are identified within projects and must be reviewed regularly in order to mitigate and manage the likelihood of them occurring.

<i>The management of risk provides assurances to the customer of a quality service. The quality of the service is addressed with the customer at the end of every sprint and project. Risk cannot be avoided. By providing a means to capture risks and assigning an owner to the management of the risk logs with regular reviews we can carefully monitor the progress of mitigation against each risk.</i>

#### Efficient Operations

The operation on our business must be as efficient as possible in order to enjoy bigger margins and to be competitive in our pricing. 

Effective operations includes:

<ul>
	<li>Maintaining well trained, skilled and happy staff</li>
	<li>Reviewing the cost of seeking and winning business</li>
	<li>Reviewing our processes to identify and implement improvements</li>
	<li>Communicating regularly to discuss and manage individual needs, project needs and business needs and providing the means to communicate and record suggestions for improvement</li>
	<li>The management of non-conformities and preventive actions</li>
	<li>Continuous QMS reviews and improvement</li>
</ul>

The efficiency of our operations will be measured by:

<ul>
	<li>Implementing a skills matrix and training plan that meets the needs of the business</li>
	<li>Reviewing new business acquisition regularly, identifying and implementing efficiency</li>
	<li>The upkeep of the QMS Change Request backlog</li>
	<li>Bug tracking</li>
	<li>Regular, planned internal audits and management reviews</li>
</ul>
