##QMS Change Requests

Changing any part of the QMS effectively changes how we operate as a business. It's important that we continue to evolve and adapt in order to improve but the changes need to be managed carefully. We manage all change requests and implementations via Rally.

If you'd like to request a change then please create a user story and add it to the [Wunderroot > QMS backlog](https://rally1.rallydev.com/#/18084711157d/backlog). Try to be as descriptive as possible.
