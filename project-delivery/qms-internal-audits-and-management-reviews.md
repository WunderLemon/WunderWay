title: QMS Internal Audits & Management Reviews
---
In order to maintain an effective and efficient operation we need to continually review our QMS. Its implementation and its effectiveness are imperative to our success.

### Internal Audit

The Internal audit is carried out twice a year by the QMS Manager and a supporting director.

A schedule of audits are listed in Internal Audit Schedule to ensure that all elements of the QMS are audited across the year. The date of all audits is contained in the specified naming convention (see below).

The purpose of the audit is to identify the quality of implementation of the QMS and to identify whether there is any training requirement or actions necessary to better implement it across all projects.

Internal audits select a project - or multiple sprints if the project is longer term - and carry out a series of checks. An important objective of the internal audit is to identify the root cause of non-conformities.

An Internal Audit will not necessarily look at all aspects of the QMS relating to a project. The Internal Audit can look at specific elements of the project. For example, one audit might look at the overall project development and delivery, another might look at the sales process.

If the audit identifies any issues relating to the QMS then each of these should be raised as a QMS Change Request.

### Management Review

The management review takes place once a year (minimum) and is carried out by the QMS manager and a supporting director. The dates of past and future reviews are listed in the Management Review Schedule. The date of all reviews are included in the specified naming convention (see below).

The purpose of the management review is to look at the results of Internal Audits, Corrective and Preventive actions, the quality policy, the control of non-conforming products and customer satisfaction to see whether the QMS is providing the inputs to achieve the quality objectives.
