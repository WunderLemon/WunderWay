title: Dealing with Customer Complaints
---
In the event of a customer complaining about any issue we deal with these on a personal level. If we want to be seen to be taking the complaint seriously then it cannot be dealt with via a standard ticketing system.

In the event of a complaint this will be dealt with by the Project Director. 

The process for dealing with customer complaints is as follows:
<ul>
	<li>When the initial complaint is received full details of the complaint are recorded in the WR - Customer Complaints Register stored in the Reviews & Assessments folder in the project repository. See <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahb4YZjQwNDgdEZYLWRjWkM2RHE5Q0ZFZlZtemc4MWc#gid=0">template</a>.
	<li>If the Project Director did not receive the original complaint then they must be made aware of it by phone or email as soon as possible
	<li>If the Project Director is unavailable, the Scrum Master will take responsibility
	<li>The Project Director (or Scrum Master) contact the client to advise them that the complaint is being investigated and they give a time/date within which they will next contact
	<li>The Project Director performs an investigation including:
	<ul>
		<li>A review of the complaint
		<li>Interviewing the staff responsible
		<li>Identifying the root cause
		<li>Reviewing products or services (if applicable)
		<li>Updating the Customer Complaints Register
	</ul>
	<li>The Project Director then prepares a response for the client together with a plan for resolution
	<li>The Project Director contacts the client and presents the findings of the investigation together with the resolution plan
	<li>The Project Director is continues to update the Customer Complaints Register until the issue is closed
</ul>

The customer complaints register is also reviewed at the end of every sprint to identify any opportunities for preventive actions if these have not already been implemented by the Project Director in the course of their investigation and resolution.

Because complaints are a type of non-conformity we also maintain generic complaints register in order to create the metrics necessary to measure how well we deal with complaints across the business:
