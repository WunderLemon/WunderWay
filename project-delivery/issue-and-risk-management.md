title: Issue & Risk Management
---

Every project includes registers to record details of risks, issues and dependencies.

The management of issues and risks is key to the success of our projects. We're very transparent in the management of risks and share the management and progress of these openly with the client. Sharing decisions on risk management allows us to use the skills and experience of a wider team.

These will be reviewed weekly (as a minimum) by the Product Owner and the Scrum Master.

The registers will be stored in Google Drive under the Issues & Risks folder.
