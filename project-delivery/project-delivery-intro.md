title: Introduction to Project Delivery
---
We use an Agile framework (Scrum) to deliver our projects. While Scrum allows flexibility in order to handle multiple changes throughout the life of the project, our general project processes are rigid. The processes are not overwhelming but are necessary to control the delivery and to achieve our <a href="../qms">quality objectives</a>.

There are 4 key roles within our Scrum framework:

**Product Owner**

This is a client role and it has the overall responsibility for defining the product.

**Scrum Master**

This role is responsible for the implementation of Scrum. The role also provides coaching to the Product Owner to help guide them through the project and to help them make decisions.

**The Team**

This describes the developers and designers who are responsible for developing the product.

**Project Director**

This is a high-level position that supports the Product Owner and Scrum Master while taking a birds-eye view of the project helping steer the project in the right direction. The position takes responsibility for helping guide the Product Owner and helping them prioritise stories in the product backlog. Itâ€™s a role that focuses on business priorities and value. The Project Director also takes some responsibility for aligning the project with the QMS.

Within each step of the project process we need to consider the following elements:
<ul>
	<li>Expertise - this provides quality and assurance to the customer</li>
	<li>Risk Management - risk is everywhere and needs to be managed</li>
	<li>Professionalism - this is where our experience counts</li>
	<li>Quality - our chances to shine and produce something more</li>
	<li>Openness - communication and sharing</li>
	<li>Output - the documentation that we produce</li>
</ul>

Each of these elements plays a role in us achieving our <a href="../qms">quality objectives</a>.
