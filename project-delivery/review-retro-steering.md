##Sprint Review

Every sprint ends with a demo of what's been developed. Every project is different so there's no template for the demo.

The review is recorded in a document that is saved in the project folder on Google Drive > Reviews & Assessments.

The Scrum Master will complete a written review of the sprint using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/document/d/144l235FNaD0fKoNIWyYE6oT69PO5RCWYxVWP92L4Gp4/edit">Sprint Review Template</a>. The file name describes the required format for saving the file.

Sprint reviews are used to give a clear picture to the client's project team, and their wider business if necessary, of the progress made by the project. This is a great opportunity to sell the value of what's been developed so far and to gain buy-in from others.

##Retrospectives

A retrospective is held at the end of every sprint and is a chance for the team to take a look back over the sprint and identify things that went well and what didn't go so well. The purpose of this is to look for ways to improve how we deliver projects. Some changes are specific to the individual project you're working on. Others might improve how we deliver all projects.

As always, if there's an opportunity to improve all projects then record your change request in <a href="https://rally1.rallydev.com/#/18084711157d/backlog">Rally</a>.

The retrospecive itself is written up and stored in the project's Reviews & Assessments folder. A template for the write-up is available at <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/document/d/11CTHJwRlwqjoXpri7OLus0RMDKaw4n5dcHtU_ZN8HBE/edit">Sprint Retrospective</a>. The file name describes the required format for saving the file.

##Steering Groups

Steering group meetings are held on an ad-hoc basis. The steering group is made up of senior members of the client team and the meeting is held with the Scrum Master (as a minumum) and often the Project Director.

Steering group meetings are used to discuss the progress of the project and the direction it's planning to take. We use these meetings to discuss budgets, spend and forecast, risks and how we're managing them. These meetings are a good opportunity to get decisions made and to unblock and issues that are slowing progress.

The meetings are chaired by the client with Wunderroot presenting a summary of the project's key points. 

We maintain copies of the steering group presentations in the project's <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/#folders/0Bxb4YZjQwNDgb1Z3WFNqMU1ncVk">Meetings > Steering Group</a> folder. See this folder for an example of the steering group presentation.
