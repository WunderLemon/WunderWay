title: Our Company Character
---

There are four key charactestics that define the way we work. We are:

## Expert
We develop deep knowledge of our areas of work and our tools. We know how to research and learn, and we believe in continually developing our expertise, investing time and money.

## Professional
We take a pride in the way we work, and the quality of what we deliver. We develop tools to enable us to deliver more effectively, and to higher, more consistent standards.

## Open
We want to be the most open company it is possible to be. That means transparency in the way we work, and frank honesty about our thoughts and experiences. Clients know us for being an honest friend to them. 

As well as open-sourcing our software (and using open source software developed by others), we open up and share other tools, documents, knowledge and information.

## Collaborative
We play nicely with others. We easily form 'one team' on a project regardless of which organisations the people on the team come from - our own, clients, or 3rd party suppliers. We collaborate and contribute widely in the communities we are part of. We always help those we work with to do the best work possible, and allow them to help us do the same.


# Character In Action
This company character can help guide us in making the right decisions about our daily work, projects, and the way we run the company. For example:

- if there's something we don't feel we can be **open** about, perhaps that's a warning sign that it might not be the right thing to do.
- if there's something we don't have genuine **expertise** in, and can't build that expertise in a suitable timeframe, then that's not an area we should undertake work in.
- if a client isn't prepared to work in a very **collaborative** way with us, perhaps we're not a good fit for each other.

# Continuous Improvement
In line with our principle of continuous improvement, we will always be able to get better at living up to our character. Therefore whenever any of us, even the newest recruit, spots room for improvement we communicate that frankly and helpfully.
