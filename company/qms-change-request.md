title: QMS Change Requests
---

Our processes describe the best ways for us to manage projects, people and clients. As an Agile evangelist we're always looking to review and improve everything we do.

We need you to help us improve. If you identify any better way of working, of delivering a project, of reviewing a sprint or developing others then record it in the [QMS backlog](https://rally1.rallydev.com/#/18084711157d/backlog) in Rally.

The QMS Manager reviews these regularly. If your change request is urgent then let your managing director know. Otherwise it'll be reviewed in due course with the other requests.

How we implement each change will depend on the impact of that change.
