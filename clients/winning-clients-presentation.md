## Structuring Our Pitch Presentation
A sales pitch is a battle for time and attention. Structure is the biggest weapon in the fight.

On average, a buyer’s attention starts at about the mid-point, tracks up briefly, then declines towards a final bump upwards in the last five to 10 minutes.

Structure introduces a strategy to engage people over the phases of the meeting, drawing attention up during lulls, and making the most of the final bump.

In James Bond films, 60% of the budget goes on the first 10 minutes, 10% on the last 10 mins – translating this structure to a pitch presentation will give it impact.

## Telling Stories
Making great stories come to life counteracts lulls in attention. Stories are real, they force clients to visualize, they get in under the radar, stick in their minds and reinforce inferred proofs.

Take them through business case and show them, through stories, how we know what we’re talking about.

The aim is to leave the customer with a clear picture of what the world will look like partnering with Wunder teams.

### Different types of stories

#### Origins
These are stories about where we’ve come from and how we’ve grown, as a business and as a team of individuals. They answer questions about the stability of the company, its size and scope, credibility and values.

#### Extremes
These stories often take the form of seemingly throwaway anecotes, but have an impact that people will remember and will make all the other evidence we give (e.g. client retention rates) stick in their minds.
e.g. Extreme client loyalty – one of Joonas’s clients in Finland was so happy he cried when the project ended and Wunderkraut left.

#### Rescues
Stories of bringing clients back from the brink, saving their project or stopping them making expensive mistakes.
e.g. Client rescue: the client that said ‘No’ to a Wunder team, went to a competitor who screwed up their project, then got WK back in – the company we are pitching to won’t want to be the next to do this.
e.g. Our project rescues: things that didn’t work within a project that we then figured out and fixed – this shows openness and honesty, as well as capability.

#### Journeys
These tell the story of the start point, mid point and finish point of another client’s site project, for example through screen grabs – it lets a prospective client experience our service approach.

#### Relationships
Stories about the clients we’ve worked with from the very start (theirs or ours); the people at a client who’ve moved with Wunder teams when they’ve moved business themselves. These stories help take the feeling of risk out of buying for the prospective client.

#### Redemption
These stories touch on things we got wrong, but where we really learnt something, adapted to change and fixed it.
They show that we’re not superheroes but people who get results, that we make mistakes for ours customers before they did, and that we accept responsibility for our mistakes.

#### Future 
Stories that explain how we think it will be or could be for the customer – things we’ll be able to do for them in 18 months’ time if they choose us. They generate the feeling that we want to develop a longer-term connection.

## Delivering Believably
For the customer to believe and trust our pitch, we need to deliver it congruently:
Intersperse creative stories among the process details and business cases to make the points feel real to clients, rather than dropped in purely to impress.

Rehearse even if you think you don’t need to – any lack of confidence in our pitch presentation and answers comes across as a lack of confidence in our service delivery.
