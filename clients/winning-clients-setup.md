title: Winning Clients - Set up for Delivery
---

There needs to be a smooth transition from the sales process to the project delivery process. 

This involves:

- An on-boarding meeting with key project team members and the client
- Setting up our shared project folders
- Setting up the project on the selected project management tool
- Setting up a project email group
- Setting up a project room in Hipchat and inviting key client staff
- Planning the discovery period

Some projects will require other setup steps to be decided by the team.
