title: Winning New Clients - Agreement
---

Congratulations! You've taken an opportunity all the way through our Stop/Go gates, and as a result of your work the client has also decided to select us.

Now we must put in place a suitable foundation for the relationship, and this project, in the form of an agreement.

This is partly the contract, partly setting out the expectations about delivery, and partly about setting expectations about how we will work together.

## Our Framework Agreement
We deliver hundreds of successful web projects every year, and have developed a suitable set of template contracts that help set a project and client/supplier relationship up for long-term success.

It is fair and balanced. In fact, the Legal Director of one large ethics-focused NGO we worked for described it as the fairest, most balanced contract he had ever encountered, and signed it off without any alterations.

Ideally we use this contract.


## Clients' Own Contracts
Unfortunately many clients have been burned by experiences with other agencies in our industry, and their procurement or legal teams insist on using a contract they draft, or their standard supplier contract. These contracts can actually cause problems for the project and the client.

We must do what we can to negotiate these contracts into shape to support a successful outcome. 

In time, clients learn to trust us and can see that our framework provides the basis for project success, and they then switch to using it.


## Negotiating Contracts

### We only do truly Agile projects
The first problem that tends to happen is that the client's legal/procurement team will insist on strictly defining exactly what will be delivered, the fixed budget and the delivery date. This is not an agile project. We recommend fixing the budget and the timeline and flexing the scope. We will not fix both scope and time/budget, and will walk away from contracts that try to do this, even after having gone all the way through the sales process.

### We don't do discounts
We are worth what we charge. The rates we charge keep us healthy as a company and able to focus on our clients' best interests rather than running around desperately trying to win new business all the time. 

If the client needs a lower budget then we can look at contracting for fewer person/days - on the understanding that this will reduce what can be delivered.

### We only do projects that will succeed
That means that if we see signs in the contract neotiation that the client organisation has an unhealthy culture, or attitude to working with suppliers, we will walk away.
