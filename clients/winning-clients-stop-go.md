title: Winning Clients - Stop/Go
---

The decision to bid or not to bid is based on two things: our evaluation of the information available and our gut feeling.

We put all new opportunities through the Stop/Go decision gate at numerous points. This is because it is better and cheaper for us to get to 'No' as soon as possible.

# Stop/Go Decision Points

1. As soon as we receive an opportunity.
2. After Sales Discovery.
3. After Plan & Prove work.
4. After Presentation.
5. ...or any other point at which the information or your gut feel changes.

# Making a Stop/Go Decision

The fundamental questions to ask before entering into a pitch process are:

- Do we want it?
- Can we win it?

If the answer to either is ‘No’ or even 'Not Sure', our efforts are likely to be better spent on other opportunities.

### Do we want it?
- Is the project itself economically viable?
- Is the client one we want to work with? See [Our Kind of Client](/clients/our-kind-of-client)
- Can we put together a good team for the timescale of the project?
- Would we benefit as a company, as a brand, as a team of professionals?
- Would we enjoy the work, and be proud of it?

### Can we win it?
- Can we do what the client needs us to do, really well?
- Do we know people on the client side and have beneficial relationships with them?
- Who are we competing against? Are we able to match and exceed their strengths? How are their relationships with the client?

## Putting together a team
A key consideration at this stage is whether we have the right people with the right level of availability to undertake our Winning New Clients process. We need:

- A project sponsor: usually someone based close to the customer, or with particularly in-depth knowledge about the sector
- A project leader: someone with enough experience of our Winning New Clients process, who can co-ordinate the team and make key decisions. They will put together the business case.
- A tech lead: someone with expertise in the relevant technologies and challeneges involved in the project. They will put together the technical proposal, and lead the estimation.
- An assistant: They will help the team with research, admin, travel arrangements etc

At least one of the project sponsor, project leader, or technical lead should have availability to continue on to deliver the project if we are successful, and on large projects it should be at least two.

If we can't put together a suitable team, with enough availability, then we must say 'Stop' at this point.


## If It’s ‘Stop’
Remember that contact should never end with ‘NO’. Firstly, we want to provide some value in every contact with other people and organisations. Secondly, there may be other ways to work together in future.

Look at ways to maintain a relationship and develop future opportunities.

- Give the client advice – e.g. to improve their pitch process or technical approach, or to help ensure their project succeeds
- Offer training – invest to show our professionalism and capabilities
- Look to build the relationship – can you get to know them in a social/business setting?
- Keep in touch – stay on their radar and aware of their plans.


## If It’s ‘Go’
It’s time to make plans.
