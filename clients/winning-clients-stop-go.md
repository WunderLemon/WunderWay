title: Winning Clients - Stop/Go
---

The decision to bid or not to bid is based on two things: our evaluation of the information gathered in the Discovery phase and our gut feeling.

The fundamental questions to ask before entering into a pitch process are:

- Do we want it?
- Can we win it?

If the answer to either is ‘No’, our efforts may well be better spent chasing other opportunities.

- Do we want it?
- Is the project itself economically viable?
- Is the client one we want to work with?
- Can our team stretch?
- Would we benefit as a company, as a brand, as a team of professionals?

- Can we win it?
- Can we do what the client needs us to do?
- Do we know people on the client side and have beneficial relationships with them?
- Who are we competing against? Are we able to match and exceed their strengths? How are their relationships with the client?

## If It’s ‘Stop’
Remember that contact should never end with ‘NO’. Firstly, we want to provide some value in every contact with other people and organisations. Secondly, there may be other ways to work together in future.

Look at ways to maintain a relationship and develop future opportunities.

- Give the client advice – e.g. to improve their pitch process or technical approach, or to help ensure their project succeeds
- Offer training – invest to show our professionalism and capabilities
- Look to build the relationship – can you get to know them in a social/business setting?
- Keep in touch – stay on their radar and aware of their plans.


## If It’s ‘Go’
It’s time to make plans.
