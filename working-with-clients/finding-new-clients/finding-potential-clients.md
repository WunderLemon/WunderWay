## Relationships
A large proportion of our sales are repeat business from satisfied customers.

## Referrals
The next largest proportion of our news business comes as a result of existing clients recommending us to someone else.

## Procurement Processes
These are generally the worst way to enter into new client relationships for projects with a realistic chance of success, because they don't focus on the realistic or relationship part at all - just numbers and promises. The agency that makes the most promises for the lowest number tends to win. We don't tend to work on that basis, as you might imagine.
We put all RFP opportunities we receive through a rigorous set of tests for a Stop/Go decisions. See the Winning New Clients section for details of this.

## Events
We sometime exhibit at conferences and exhibitions, or simply attend as delegates. The key here is that we don't aim to sell anything, just to start relationships that may one day become client relationships. We should only aim to provide value, with advice and experience, to other delegates, rather than sell anything.

## Advertising
We almost never do advertising. It takes such a large spend to make a memorable impact and produce results (like a consumer brand), and with our very niche target market it is wasted money, which would be better spent in a more focused way.
