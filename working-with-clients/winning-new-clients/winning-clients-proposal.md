title: Winning Clients - Proposal

We don’t start writing until we’ve thought about the structure first, and at least sketched an outline to guide our writing.

These are the steps to creating a winning document...

## Storyboard
A storyboard is a page-by-page outline of the full proposal document we’re creating. It helps us keep sight of the whole picture as we write the details of the story. It sets a guide for the content we need to gather and prevents us gathering content we don’t need.
[TOOL: Example Storyboard for Proposals](https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/document/d/16yZT6ukxPDywPZD4SCa2d_k9Yw45SQjFiiFY_BYUhzo/edit)

Base the structure of the document on the specifications in the RFP – this will keep the format familiar to the client and help them find the information they are looking for. Making the experience straightforward for them will put them in a good frame of mind from the start.

Create a page in the storyboard for each section. Write three or four bullet points for each section, highlighting the main messages you need to cover. These messages should relate directly to the values identified in the Question Tree.

See how different values identified by the tree cover the RFP specifications. There may be some overlap between each and others might appear more than once – it’s about seeing the relationship between the overall values and the specifics.

Build up the bullet points with specific information on the features, benefits and USPs for each of the messages.

Identify the kinds of proofs each section needs. Note which proofs you already have prepared, which you are aware of but have yet to document, and which you need to discover from your colleagues.

## Gather and write content
Use the structure you defined in the storyboarding stage and stick to it as closely as possible. Uncovering new information or understanding may mean changes are necessary, but the amount of discovery and planning work you’ve done should make this unlikely.

Assign each page of the storyboard to someone on the pitch team and give them the responsibility of finding, gathering and creating the content stipulated.

Set a clear deadline for the first draft of each section of the document. Make sure the person coordinating the proposal document sends reminders to content creators as their deadlines approach.

## Review first draft
Choose a small group of people close to the project to review your draft. Too many opinions could lead you to suffering feedback overload.

Make sure at least one reviewer (preferably non-technical) isn’t directly involved in the project. Your document will benefit from input from their bigger-picture, less-detailed view.

If at all possible, try to test the messages and proofs by talking through the document with the client you’re pitching to.

## Refine and improve messages
Refer back to your initial storyboard and structure. Check that the paragraphs and pages you’ve written contain all of the main messages you outlined, and that they come across clearly.

If they don’t, query whether the meaning is blurred because of poor writing or poor content. If it’s the former, rewrite those sentences. If it’s the latter, discuss ways to improve the clarity with your first-draft reviewers, perhaps through additional proofs, better proofs, diagrams, etc.

## Edit down
Your document will inevitably grow larger than it needs to be. Aim to cut at least 20% of the content from your first draft. It might feel brutal but it’s necessary – you’ll make it sharper, easier to read and better quality.

## Involve design and production
A bit of design goes a long way in making your document more appealing and more memorable. Factor design and production time into your document timeline, and check well ahead of time that your designers will be available when you need them.

The contents of your document should be 80-90% settled when you turn it over to a designer for the first time. Their work will help you see which areas need changes or additions, but you don’t want to waste their time creating a layout for content you then extensively alter.

## Give final review
At this stage you want useful feedback, focused on refining what you have. Ask only one or two people to do the final review, and select them carefully. You don’t want someone uninvolved until now sweeping in and making broad-brush suggestions that would only be useful if you had an extra week.

## Proofread
This is not a review. It’s designed purely to pick up errors and inconsistencies. Ask someone outside the pitch process to do the proofread, so they’re not tempted to make or suggest bigger changes.

## Deliver
Get it in on time. Aim to be ready 24 hours before the actual deadline to give yourself a bit of wriggle room (which you’ll almost inevitably use).

When you submit the proposal, craft the covering email as well as the rest of the proposal. It should set us apart from the competition as much as the main document. The client will see lots of emails along the lines of "Regarding your recent request for proposal, please fine our submission attached. How can yours stand out?


## Quick Tips to Avoid Obvious Pitfalls

- Write the proposal through a client lens
- Always focus on your value propositions
- Plan the process and timing for document content and production
- Bring in experts early
