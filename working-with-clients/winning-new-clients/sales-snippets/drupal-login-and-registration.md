title: Drupal - Login and Registration
---

Drupal already includes a secure and robust registration and login system. It’s modular and highly extensible. This means you can design it to suit the needs of your users. By creating a lean, easy to complete registration you remove the barriers that will prevent some users from registering. Conversely, a comprehensive registration process, combined with a well considered UX, can also provide a lot of information in a simple way.

We’ll customise it to suit your requirements for enforcing password strength, password change routines and other security steps. We’ll also work closely with you to develop the right level of security.

It’s possible to integrate with third-party, two-factor authentication solutions. This can provide secure staff access or simply limits staff or admin access by IP range, so it can only be accessed from your network. Login and registration can be forced to an https protocol if required.

Once a user registers or logs in, we can customise where they will be taken to in the site based on certain factors - e.g. if they still need to complete some of their profile.

We can also customise login and registration to gather further information from a user to begin their profile.

All customer data will be stored within the CMS. Your authorised users will have access to this data and be able to filter and export if necessary.
