title: Drupal - Social Networking
---

Linking your site and promoting your content through social networking is simple with Drupal and can help you benefit from the interaction with a much larger audience. It also helps to create the feel of a community when your users provide feedback about experiences with your product or expert advice for the benefit of others.

**Twitter**

We can provide you with options to automatically tweet about new products or articles from your experts. They can be automatically formatted based on the content and youâ€™ll have the option to override them too.

We can also publish your Twitter content on your site in a stream, perhaps configured to show content with hashtags relevant to each page content.

**Facebook**

A user can automatically post to their Facebook page and invite their friends to register on your site with direct links.
