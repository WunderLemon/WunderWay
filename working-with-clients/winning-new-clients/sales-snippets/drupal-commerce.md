title: Drupal - Drupal Commerce
---

Drupal has expanded way beyond its early incarnation as a simple CMS. As developers began to fully understand its potential a community of developers began to grow to support and develop it, as is the nature of open source.

Today there is a Drupal community of developers. In fact, the Drupal.org website has just announced its one millionth member.

One of the major developments within Drupal has been Drupal Commerce. This has provided strong, scalable and robust ecommerce functionality to the CMS to make this a very comprehensive solution for managing online retail sites.

While ecommerce is not part of this first phase of the project itâ€™s important for you to understand the potential that Drupal Commerce has to the overall project and how this can enhance the viability of Drupal as the chosen CMS.

Commerce Guys, the company behind Drupal Commerce, a company that Wunderkraut partner with on key projects, have prepared a paper to help you understand the capability and scale of the commerce side of Drupal so that you can give this consideration when making your decision.
