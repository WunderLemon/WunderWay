title: Drupal - Product Management
---

Drupal provides a wide range of tools and functionality with which you can create rich content. From defining different types of products to refining layout, to integrating keyword and SEO strategy, the Drupal CMS can cater for all retailing requirements.

###Product Types

Drupal provides the facility to manage a wide range of different types of products, each with very different criteria. The number of these different product types is unlimited and you can add more (or remove others) as requirements change. Whether you’re adding a t-shirt or a coffee machine, a single, all-encompassing product type can be used or you can choose to create individual product types that capture information specific to the different types of products on offer.

Products usually have common elements - those that we need to include in searches and those that help customers find the products, whether that’s through the navigation, the search, social sharing or browser optimisation.

There will often be a need to relate products to one another. Products can be cross-promoted where they will be of interest to the customer. For example, those that comprise a certain look, a party outfit, goes well with, accessories for furniture and trending products. We can provide ways to specify individual products to link to within a product or these can be more automated, working off a tagging system.

###Editor Tools

The interface for editing product and page content can differ depending on what’s being edited. Different brands may require different landing pages or approaches to displaying content and the editor for this content can flex to accommodate this.

The CMS is flexible enough to deal with a wide range of content, from standard page content including Checkout pages, About Us, Returns and Shipping pages to brand pages, product pages and campaign pages.

Content editing can be enhanced with the use of WYSIWYG and media tools to create richer content. Drupal supports a number of WYSIWYG editors. All of these are configurable and different toolbars can be presented to different users depending on their permissions.

Content can also be opened up to customers to enable them to comment on a product or to rate it. Ratings help gain interest in products, while comments will often provide answers to questions not answered in the product description. Comments can be set to moderate, allowing you to approve this content before it’s shown on the site.

###Bespoke Layout

Editors have the flexibility to create bespoke layouts for individual pages or collections. For the purpose of special promotions or due to the specific requirements of a particular brand, the layout of pages can break out of the standard templates applied to the site.

Your editors can use Drupal controls to structure pages through the CMS - there is no need for hand-coding HTML. Editors will be able to use pre-built content blocks, remove navigation, add image transitions and click-and-drag content into position.

Content blocks are also used for common elements, such as the header and footer, to make them easy to manage.

A series of templates can be pre-defined for users to choose from or they can add new templates. Templates can contain regions into which the user can drag content such as products, features and adverts.

###SEO - Search Engine Optimisation

There are a number of key optimisation factors editors should focus on when creating or managing content. For example, content should:

*	Be as relevant as possible to the topic
*	Include subject in the title tag
*	Include subject in the unique URL
*	Include subject in the image alt text
*	Specify subject in the content (without stuffing)
*	Include headings to structure and prioritise the content (H1 - H5)
*	Try to provide unique content about the subject
*	Link back to the category page (relevant linking)
*	Link back to the homepage

The CMS will provide your editors with access to all of the relevant fields. Field content can be automatically generated based on product names. For example, the structure of the URL can include the product name and the category, and this can be automatically generated with the option to allow some editors to override if they need to tweak it.

A URL is a unique value, that cannot be duplicated whether it’s automatically generated or overridden by a user.

The CMS can automatically generate tags to be displayed on this page. This can be based on the content the editor is writing, so it stays relevant.

Links, including breadcrumbs, can be automatically generated.

Automating content creation helps to reduce the overhead on content editors. It also forces structure and consistency throughout the site, which is good for the user experience. However, it’s important to maintain manual overrides because there will always be edge cases that need to be managed slightly differently, their content tweaked to help it perform as efficiently and effectively as possible.

###Keyword Strategy

Keyword strategy should be considered just as important for multi-channel optimisation as SEO. Multi-channels platforms include Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn and email.

Keyword consistency between all of the platforms will not only help your branding efforts but can also train your users to use specific phrases you’re optimising for.

Implementing a multi-channel strategy helps you widen the net used to capture customers. Widening the net across social media platforms helps to increase the opportunities to speak to them on their ground while providing them with the functionality to share their interests, your products and brands, with friends.

We can include the option for your content creators to publish links and messages on these platforms at the point when products, brands and campaigns are set live. This streamlines the marketing process while maintaining it within a workflow to ensure the quality of the messages and the content to which it’s linking.
