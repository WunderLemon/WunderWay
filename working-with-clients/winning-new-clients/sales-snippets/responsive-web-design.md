As the quantity and diversity of web connected devices continues to increase, it becomes more important to broaden the range of devices that websites support. We build websites that support a long tail of devices, while optimising for the key high value devices for your business.

We achieve this by basing our design and development processes heavily on the principles of progressive enhancement, mobile first, and responsive web design.

The principle of progressive enhancement and agile development guides us to build websites that can walk before they can run, and talk before they can sing. While building the essentials first, we ensure that they work without the requirements of any particular technology, such as a mouse, keyboard, or touch screen. We then build more useful and desirable interactions on top of this foundation, but only for devices that can handle it. This ensures that our enhancements for the high value devices do not prevent the basic requirements of long tail devices.

The principle of mobile first is an extension of progressive enhancement and guides us to consider the more basic devices that don't have  a lot of screen space to display content. Taking this perspective at a very early stage in the design process improves our decision making on information architecture and basic user journeys.

We are experienced in designing complex interactions on mobile and desktop devices, including content management work flows. We've built content management systems that work on all devices and can provide tools that make it easier for content creators to tailor their content to multiple devices.
