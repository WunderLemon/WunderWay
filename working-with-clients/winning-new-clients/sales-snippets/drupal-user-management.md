title: Drupal - User Management

Itâ€™s important to put in place the appropriate controls to manage your users. Managing users is about creating roles, then creating users who can be assigned to those roles. This approach helps you manage a lot of users on a wide scale. Your authorised users (usually the website administrators) can create and manage user accounts through the CMS.

The administrators will also be able to create very specific access for individuals who do not fall within a particular role, or for those who have access requirements beyond the roles assigned to them. You can keep the management of users simple, creating only a few key roles, or you can control access at a very granular level.

Roles and individual access rules can be applied and removed quickly and easily through the CMS. This allows you to react quickly to changing requirements, such as adding temporary staff at Christmas, dealing with staff leaving the organisation, and reassigning roles to cover sickness or other absence.

User management can be coupled to workflow to give you full control over how content is created, checked, approved and published. See the Workflow Management section for more information on this.
