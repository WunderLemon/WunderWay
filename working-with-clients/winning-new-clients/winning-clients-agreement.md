It's important to clarify the way the relationship will work, and the expectations for the project in a good agreement.

This should cover:

- The scope of the project (without too much detail, as this will change as more is learned, but for now we can cover the broad outline)
- the budget of the project and payment terms
- the fact that the project will be delivered using agile methodologies
- the fact that the project will be delivered using open source

We have a template agreement in each country to facilitate this. Please see your country MD for details.

We are working on standardising these, and also open sourcing them, and will publish more details here soon.
