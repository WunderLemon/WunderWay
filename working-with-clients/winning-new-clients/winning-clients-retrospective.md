title: Winning New Clients - Retrospective
---

After our work on every opportunity we conduct a retrospective - win or lose.

The review will look at:

- what the client thought of our company, team, propositions, process and pitch
	TOOL: Sales Retrospective Client Questionnaire
- what we thought of our propositions, process and pitch
	TOOL: Sales Retrospective Team Questionnaire
- what new knowledge we learned and content we created that we need to capture for future use
- what gaps we noted in our research, relationships, proofs, stories that we need to fill for next time
