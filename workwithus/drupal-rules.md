title: Drupal - Rules
---

Rules is a framework within Drupal which enables you to manage your site’s reactions automatically, for example sending acknowledgements when users contact the site.

The Rules are effectively a trigger when a condition is met and can be used very flexibly.  What’s great about them is that they reduce the amount of time you spend manually managing and intervening in your site.

Rules is an excellent tool to help you implement automated processes that present personalised information to individuals. This improves their experience of your site and encourages them to keep returning.

Rules run 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. It’s a very extensible framework that can be used to automate much of your site. Other examples include:

*	Sending emails or SMS when a condition is met, such as a product that meets the users preferences
*	Displaying notifications on the screen
*	Automating the sending of personalised emails when new products are released, when products are on offer or when new expert information is published that meets the users preferences.
*	Redirecting a user automatically to a page or section on a page depending on an answer they’ve provided.

We recently used Rules within the marimekko.fi website which depends heavily on them, particularly the eCommerce integration.

There, Rules automate the categorisation of imported content depending on certain properties, manage price and tax calculations, manage scheduled publishing and unpublishing of content, send confirmation emails and handle conditional redirects.

When users sign-up to receive content we can capture a little information about their preferences and use this to send them targeted messages, emails and alerts.
