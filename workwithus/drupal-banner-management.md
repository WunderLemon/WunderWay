title: Drupal - Banner Management
---

The management of banners across your site includes the upload of images, the creation of transitional banners and the placement of banners across the site.

The upload of still imagery, video and other documents is managed through the media management tool. The CMS provides the functionality to use this content across your site to drive traffic, and to promote campaigns, new products and ranges.

The CMS has a concept of content blocks. A content block can be created, into which you place images, rotating banners, links and text, for example. You can style these content blocks to meet the requirements of your designers. Content blocks can then be placed throughout the site, either on individual pages or in generic regions. You can apply publishing criteria to show the blocks within a period of time.

The CMS also provides you with the functionality to create rotating banners. These can incorporate images, text, links and a variety of transitional effects. 

Obviously, such functionality can leave you open to abuse or mistakes from less experienced staff. This functionality can be restricted to only those with certain roles or with individual permissions.

Importantly, the creation of content blocks and advertising content does not require hand-coded HTML. The management of this content is done via the CMS, using a powerful combination of template management with media management, drag-and-drop functionality, content regions and workflow management.
