title: Drupal - Templates and Views
---

Template layouts can create consistency across your site, and our designers will work with you to define these layouts. The simplicity of the Drupal CMS makes it ideal for users of all abilities.

Templates are configurable and, over time, you can modify and add templates via the CMS. Similarly, existing templates can be edited to add or remove fields and other content.

Theyâ€™re achieved using Views in Drupal and create different layouts on the site and within the CMS. They comprise common elements, content blocks and menus. Together, these can be configured to generate any number of layouts.

Templates are an excellent way to make changes en masse. For example, if a number of pages display template xyz, any changes to that template will cascade through all content displayed with that template.

Certain elements will often be generic across the site, e.g. logo or footer information. Templates will allow you to manage all of these instances in a central location.

There is a lot of power and flexibility in views. This can be exposed to provide your content editors with the ability to create some very bespoke pages specifically for individual brands in order to focus on specific selling points. These bespoke pages would still be managed via the CMS in the same way standard content pages would be.
