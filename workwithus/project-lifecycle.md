We run all of Wunderkraut’s projects using the Agile project management methodology, specifically the Scrum framework. We’ll train your project staff in Agile and coach them on implementing it throughout the website project. We’ll also boost Agile’s effectiveness in generating continuous improvement by applying Wunderkraut’s ISO9001-certified quality management system to the project.

###Implementing the Solution

Agile-Scrum makes our development approach flexible and transparent, and puts the your team in control of the direction of your project. We will develop and deliver iteratively, so you get completed functionality every two weeks.

In the **Discovery** phase we will review all of your existing research, ensure all user stories have been captured, and look for areas of complexity and risk. Using Agile means we won’t define everything up front but we will develop a clear plan that focuses on delivering the most value and managing the risks.
In the **Alpha** phase we will prototype the areas of complexity and risk in the project. This generally includes any integrations. User experience (UX) is important to the project, so this stage is likely to involve prototyping elements of the user journey to give us early feedback from real users.
In the **Beta** phase we will start building the real product. We will deliver working iterations every two weeks for testing by your team. The aim at the end of the phase is that the project could be launched, with the key features, as a beta for a limited trial with real users. In the case of [client]’s project this might include running a test exercise, or even running a small lower-profile real exercise.
In the **Live** phase we take feedback and learning from the beta testing and refine the final product, as well as completing any other non-core work.

Once the Live phase is complete the project as a whole will be complete and ready to deploy. At this stage the project will be smoothly handed over to our support and service management teams, with a gradual transition period.
