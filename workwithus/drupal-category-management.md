Creating categories - to dual-merchandise products, add selected category links to the navigation, cross-link categories and promote categories through social channels - is a great way to drive traffic through the site, maintain customer interest and increase the chances of conversion.

CMS users have access rights so they can manage the categories that help customers navigate their way around the site.

Categories and multiple levels of sub-categories can be created and, depending on your requirements, we can publish these in the main navigation, promote them throughout the site or use them in sub-navigation as filters for your customers.

Products are assigned to categories and they can also be dual-merchandised to promote them in their parent category as well as in a sale, a reduced category or in a campaign. You can’t guarantee how your customers will search for specific products and this is a great way to help them, to improve their experience and journey on your site.

The CMS lets you create a category, add products and content to that category, and preview it within the site before it’s published and visible on the live site. This gives you a great opportunity to fully prepare for the launch of a new brand, collection or campaign.

Category pages will have their own landing page, whether it’s a parent category (e.g. Beauty, Women or Home) or a sub-category (e.g. Skincare, Dresses, or Bathroom). Each of these homepages can be tailored as required.
