title: Content Migration
---

We have a lot of experience of migrating content from other CMS platforms to Drupal. We break large data migrations into multiple migrations. Smaller amounts of content are easier to check for quality and consistency and this helps to smooth the process. Your teams can take responsibility for checking their own content as itâ€™s migrated, which lessens the burden on any one team.

Migration of data into or out of Drupal is managed by a series of modules. The modules we select depend on the requirements of the migration. All have the flexibility to deal with the acceptance of third-party data in a range of formats (text, CSV, Excel, database dumps) and we can create options to export the data back out in a range of formats too.

We can transfer the data in a number of ways. We can create a secure gateway through which to transfer the data from one server to another. We can also produce an exportable version of the data in a spreadsheet or CSV file according to specific requirements.

However this is achieved, access to the data will be controlled by secure login, and any digital transfer of the data would be subject to an additional secure layer.
