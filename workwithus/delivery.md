Wunderkraut uses Agile project management in all of our development projects. We combine its frameworks within our own ISO9001-certified quality management system to deliver successful results for our clients in a well-managed way.

Much of our success is down to our clear and adaptive approach to risk management. Our procedures keep us alert to change and able to manage it within a project. We’ve used our experience on successful website builds to propose a budget and schedule we know will create the high-quality, secure, reliable site [client] needs.

Because of our reputation for delivery, the Drupal Association asked us to provide an official training course at September’s Drupalcon Prague, leading a full-day training session on Professional Web Project Management For Drupal and a one-hour lightning-talks session on 12 Best Practices (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQUdt1lpQhI) for web projects.
