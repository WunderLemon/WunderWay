Supporting content - such as images, documents and video - can be either uploaded to a central repository or added inline while creating or editing content.

The site can be configured to restrict the size of any file being uploaded. This encourages good housekeeping and gives us a way to calculate storage capacity to plan hosting and theoretical limits.

Users uploading media are prompted to fill in fields which capture information about it. Fields include name, description and alt-tag.

The media data fields can be configured to remove or add more depending on your requirements. All of this data can be used within search and surfaced on the site.

Crop & Auto Resize Images

When images are uploaded, Drupal can automatically create a cache of different sized images, from a single large image for use around the site. When a user uploads the main image the CMS can automatically generate properly sized images from that to use in search results, category and sub-category pages, multi-use banner adverts and product previews.

Images uploaded and resized in this way reduce workload and ensure greater accuracy because automated resizing forces images to conform with templated layouts. The images are properly resized to optimise the filesize for mobile devices.

Similarly, functionality for the image-upload process can include the option to crop images, in cases where a specific area of the image is required. For example, when close-up focus on a particular material or motif is of particular interest to your customer.

As users upload content they can add information about the media, like metadata (title, keywords and description), together with tags and general descriptions. These fields can be reconfigured if requirements change later.

All of the fields added to the uploaded files can be surfaced on the site for the end-user. They can also be made available within the search in order to make finding content easier.
