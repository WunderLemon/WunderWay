title: Drupal - Automatic Links and Tags
---

There are many ways to direct users to the content they’re interested in, and we’ll work through these during the design and UX sessions.

The CMS has a number of methods to automatically create links to other relevant content and automatically tag individual content.

One way to achieve this is through the Recommender API. It uses configurable algorithms to create “users also read...” content, as used by Amazon and Netflix.com. Alternatively, we can configure Apache Solr to search and index related content to present to the user. 

Links and tags can be shown to users in different ways. We can also use the tags to narrow search results or provide links to content with specific tags. Automatically generating links and tags makes the site work for you, reduces manual work and creates the right content specifically for individual users. We can use this to keep the user on the site longer, help them find the information or product they’re looking for and help to improve conversions.
