title: Value of Open Source and our contributions to Drupal
---

Our approach, using open source Drupal, means value through quality as much as value for money. Open source is what makes Drupal user-friendly, secure, reliable, customisable, extensible and future-proof. This is because, every day, thousands of Drupal professionals exchange their knowledge, experience, ideas and code at drupal.org, continually improving the platform for all of its users. Our access to this input from a huge pool of talent — in addition to the talents of our 140 staff — means developing your site will be faster and better quality, even when we’re customising Drupal to meet your needs.

WunderRoot understands how important it is to to be actively involved in the Drupal community - because for every contribution we make, we get more out for our customers. We enthusiastically lend our support and share our expertise, online at drupal.org and in person at numerous Drupal events. We help fund and organise many of these events, including the key annual Drupalcon in Europe. Our staff have written dozens of significant modules to extend Drupal, and many are part of developing the Drupal core itself. Our user-experience designer Roy Scholten, is in charge of redesigning the user interface for the upcoming Drupal 8, while another of our developers can be seen in [this video](http://www.wunderroot.co.uk/blog/video-live-commit-major-drupal-8-patch) finalising such a key part of the upcoming Drupal 8 release he had led the work on, that the final commit of the code was performed live on stage with an audience of Drupal developers.

Our staff are not just users of Drupal who passively take it and implement it. They’re not offshore somewhere churning out code at a bargain rate. They are at the very heart of the Drupal community, actively developing it, leading key initiatives, and ensuring our clients benefit from the expertise this brings to our projects, resulting in higher quality, more secure and reliable websites. It also means the projects we build are more future-proof, providing better lifetime value, because we don’t just understand the future direction of Drupal, we are part of creating it.

Our CEO, Vesa Palmu, is also a director of the Drupal Association, governing and steering the project — and every member of our team, at every level,  is in someway actively contributing to Drupal.

Within the Drupal community we are known for the way in which we work — we get big projects delivered successfully, while also being a great supplier to work with and a great company to work for. We’d be happy to provide contacts for competing (high quality) Drupal agencies who would be happy to talk frankly about our work and our role in the community.
