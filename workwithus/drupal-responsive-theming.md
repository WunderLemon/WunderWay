title: Drupal - Responsive Theming
---

All of our sites are built for mobile first. We build only one site and build in responsive theming so that the site is viewed correctly on whichever device the user has. 

We detect the devices and can alter the content based on that device If we know that the screen is small then we’ll adapt the content, wrapping the content in correct places, presenting an alternative navigation. Developing a mobile-first responsive them leaves you with only one site to maintain and an experience that’s specifically tailored to the user.

As you add and edit your content on the site there will be an option to preview it on any device. This enables you to test the content for layout and functionality on your suite of testing devices. Only when the content has passed your testing workflow will it be released to the live site.

There is certain functionality that is unlikely to work on all mobile devices. Where there is click-and-drag functionality for example, this is difficult and problematic on some smaller screens. However, the majority of CMS functionality can be used on a mobile device.
