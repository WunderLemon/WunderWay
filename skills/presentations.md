A key part of our job is presenting our thoughts, experiences, ideas and work to our clients and community.

On this page we've gathered some resources to help you improve your presentation skills, and prepare to give a really great presentation.

You can use this page as a training module - allocate yourself half a day of training time and work through it - or you can simply use it as a reference when you have to prepare for a presentation.

And of course, feel free to improve this page with things you learn.


# Questions to Ask When You Are Asked to Give a Presentation

* What is the event?
* Who is the audience? How many will there be?
* Is there a preset theme for the talk, or can you decide your own theme?
* How long should the presentation be?
* What is the venue like - size, layout, A/V facilities, etc
* When can you get into the venue beforehand to check it out? Can they send you photos in advance or direct you to a webpage with details?
* Will there be Q&A? Will there be a moderator for that? What format will Q&A have?
* Will the slides be presented from your computer or are you required to send them in advance, or provide them on the day, for someone else to put on their computer? What format will that be in? (Our presentations are only in Keynote unless we're in an emergency fallback situation, so if they can't provide a Macbook they'll need to let you use your own computer. Be firm about this, as it's important the slides look right)
* Will you have a microphone? What type? As much as possible, insist on not just having a lecturn mic, but having one you can walk around with.


# Preparing a presentation

Always, always, always prepare a presentation in advance. Never just turn up and chat through what comes off the top of your head. It shows, no matter how good you are, and it shows that you didn't care. Always care about your audience, the time they are giving to hear you, and the value that you provide in return. Even if it's just an internal presentation you should respect your colleagues and care about giving them a great presentation.

First, think of presentations as telling stories:

And then think how you can structure that story:
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/1nYFpuc2Umk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Then you need to think of ways to present the story that will engage the audience and ensure they listen to you:

Here are some tips on preparing your slides:
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/OeV2fHEM4RI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The key parts of your presentation are the beginning and the end. You should plan these first. For the neginning, how will you engage the audience, reassure them they are in good hands, and gain their interest and curiosity in the topic? For the ending, how will you send them away remembering your key message (what is your key message?) and ready to take some kind of action as a result?

Don't try to 'sell' our company or any of our products or services in your presentation. Focus on providing real value to your audience - things that they can learn, implement and realy benefit from.

Plan a presentation to fit the timeslot. At a minimum, you should have fewer slides in your deck than minutes in your talk, and preferably many fewer. Have a run through at regular stages of preparation to see how the timing is going. Add some 'pace notes' to the speaker notes in your slides showing when you should be a certain amount of time into the talk. This allows you to do a quick check against the counter in presentator mode, and adjust your pace accordingly.

Set up a separate user account on your computer just for use when giving presentations. This will avoid any notifications from chat applications etc being displayed, or any confidential client information appearing on screen when you do demos, use a browser, etc.

Prepare your talk so that you are not dependent on anything other than you and your words. Do not rely on having an internet connection - record screencasts of anything you need to do online and embed them in slides. Do not rely on your laptop - export your finished presentation to a thumbdrive in multiple formats (Keynote, powerpoint, PDF) so that you can quickly run your slides from any other computer if yours breaks. Do not rely on having a working microphone - practice projecting your voice loudly and clearly and be prepared to do without a mic in all but the largest of venues. Think about how you would present if you couldn't get your slides to work at all, and be ready for that.

In most venues audio is the most difficult part of the A/V setup. Don't count on having audio working. This means that videos will benefit from having subtitles, and any music or sounds should not be central to your message, but just nice little touches.

Slides are used because it's important to have a visual stimulus. But maybe there are other ways to provide that instead of, or as well as, slides? You could use actual props, or a message printed on a big card. Get creative, do something to capture the audiences attention, and drive your points home in multiple ways.

You can use props, or images on screen, as an 'anchor' to which you keep returning during the talk. If you have three key points to make, have three props to represent them, at different places on the stage and return to them and interact with them when you are re-inforcing those points - or three images, to which you keep returning. That helps the audience see the structure of the talk and arrange things in their mind for later recall.

This presentation is pitched as how to present to developers, but contains lots of valuable tips for presenting to any audience. He does demonstrate this by giving some developer focused presentations as lightning talks, but stick with him for the tips:

Once you have the content of your talk, you need to prepare to give it with confidence and authority:

Some further tips on body language:

And finally, don't be a 'Chicken' by simply knocking together boring, word and data filled slides and reading them out:

# Inspiration

Here are a couple of great presentations for inspiration. 

Firstly, Hans Rosling turns what could be a dull data driven presentation into one that is engaging and inspiring - through his enthusiasm, use of stories, use of humour and more:
<iframe width="843" height="632" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/RUwS1uAdUcI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

But don't think that being engaging and inspiring means you have to talk fast and energetically. In the next video Sir Ken Robinson stands pretty still (he has a bad leg), doesn't use slides or props, and talks in a very quiet, measured way - but he has authority, a natural approach, great storytelling skills, and a good sense of humour:
<iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/iG9CE55wbtY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

And Susan Cain emphasises the point that great presentations don't need to be given by extroverts - in fact, quite the opposite. She uses a prop, stories, and a very natural way of engaging with and making eye contact with her audience. She also uses her voice well - altering pace, tone and pitch.

So the message is that you will have your own style that you are comfortable with, that allows you to engage an audience. Be yourself, be authentic, but be confident and authoratitive.

# As you approach the presentation

Get in to see the room you'll be speaking in, and any backstage area. 

Ask to do a soundcheck with the microphone you'll be using. Try to push for a lapel (lavelier) or handheld microphone so that you can move away from the lecturn. In small rooms it's often better to just speak loudly and clearly than use a lecturn mic.

What is the lighting like in the venue? Make a note of any areas you will stay within, in order to be well lit.

Set your laptop up and check your slides display correctly. Check they are fully on the screen and are not stretched or compressed in any way. Put a typical slide on, and walk around the venue to see how people will see it. Are the fonts big enough? Are there any blind spots in the venue which may mean you need to describe some of your key slides for these audience memmbers?

Can you see the presenter-mode screen so you can see what slide is next and any notes you have left yourself, as well as the time?

Check who will be introducing you, if anyone, and what they plan to say. Feel free to give them some guidance. A shorter introduction is better. Don't worry about them bigging up all your achievements.

Find out if the talk is being recorded. In what way is the recording being done? Audio only (in which case you'll need to describe some slides or visual props), slides and audio only (in which case you'll need to vocalise things you may have just conveyed in facial expressions, or describe props), or video?


What to take with you:

* A VGA adaptor for your macbook, and a VGA cable just in case
* A power lead for your macbook
* An HDMI Cable (and adaptor if necessary) for your Macbook
* A slide changer remote control (and some spare batteries for it)
* A Bluetooth external speaker so you can porvide your own audio in smaller rooms
* A bottle of water
* A thumb drive with a backup of your presentation in Keynote, exported to Powerpoint, and as a PDF.
* A clear clock display that you can put on a lecturn, table, the floor etc so that you can see it and stick to time.


# Getting ready to go onstage

Here's a checklist:

* Take off your lanyard so it doesn't flap about or knock the mic
* Smile, take deep breaths and relax.
* Make sure there is some water handy, even a bottle on the floor next to the lecturn you can reach for if needed. You won't use it most of the time, but you can guarantee that the one time it's not there is when you'll be desperate for it.
* Check your clothes are in order
* Go to the toilet, even if you think you don't need to (make sure any radio mic is off - a top tip from Naked Gun via Mark Boulton)
* Run through at least the open and close of your presentation in your mind, as if you're watching yourself on video, and imagining yourself doing the best presentation ever.


# Givng Your Presentation

Firstly, you should know that the audience are on your side. They want you to do well. that's why they are there, because they think you'll be interesting and informative, and that watching you will be a good use of their time. So feel confident and don't worry.

It's perfectly normal however to feel nervous. Even the most seasoned speakers and entertainers do. That's adrenilin, and it's a gift. The key is in channeling that adrenilin to make you more alert and present than you normally would be.

When you step on stage, acknowledge any applause and face the audience. Stand tall.

Start confidently, and engage the audience. Look into their eyes, and capture their attention. Maybe pause a moment before starting. They will relax as soon as they can see they are in the hands of someone who is in control. Pick a few friendly faces around the audience and focus on them.

Do not ever start a presentation by making a joke about being first on, in the graveyard slot, standing between them and lunch or coffee, or the last one of the day. This is the right moment and the right place for this to be a great talk.

Do not ask if the audience can hear you or read your slides. Your preparation should have checked this, and they will let you know if there are any problems.

Remember that your slides are to support your words, they are not the main focus. Do not keep looking at the screen yourself. Focus on your audience and the words you are conveying to them.

If something doesn't work during your presentation, don't highlight it or apologise - eg 'Ah sorry, there was an audio clip here but it doesn't seem to be playing'. Carry on professionally and ad lib - eg to replace the missing audio, tell the audience yourself that 'In an interview with me, Fred Bloggs described this site you can see as a highlight of good user experience design for mobile because of ...'. The audience will never know that something didn't work.

Finish in a really strong and confident way. Emphasise the ending by moving to another point on stage, changing the pace and tone of your voice, emphasising your words with gestures. Draw up your points neatly and conclusively. Leave the audience in no doubt about the main message of your talk that they should take away. After the last words, pause, and say thankyou, to prompt applause.


# Q&A

This is generally a flawed part of events, as it generally includes:

* A wait for everyone as people build up the confidence to ask something
* People asking 'questions' that are simply a string of points they want to make
* People seeking attention
* Long rambling questions
* Off-topic questions
* People promoting themselves or their companies through questions
* A lack of proper moderation that means 

Normally it's best to say that you'll be around during lunch, a break or at the end of the day if people have questions, but if the event organisers really want a Q&A, then here is the best approach:

Start by stating the amount of time that is left, and then state how many questions you will accept based on that (a good rule of thumb is 3 mins per question - so just divide the amount of time left by 3 to get how many questions you'll take, but always play safe and round down, so 10 mins means you'll take 3 questions). Say 'Thanks for listening to me, now for some questions from you. We have 10 minutes remaining, so I'll take 3 questions. Who has the first question?' - and look round the room. There will be a pause before the first hand goes up, there always is. Don't worry, a hand nearly always goes up.

In very shy audiences, very rarely, there isn't a first hand and they need some help to get going. In this case you can, after pausing for a moment, say 'Well, while you think for a moment, the question I'm most often asked about this subject is...' and then ask yourself your pre-prepared question, and then answer it. Then ask the audience 'Ok, so who has the second question'. Now, even the most shy people will be ready and the questions will start to flow. But in *really* rare situations there won't be a question. In this case, simply say 'Ok, well I'm glad I covered everything you needed within the presentation. Let's wrap up now, but I'll stay down at the front/be near the coffee/be around over lunch/be at the bar later/etc if you want to ask me a question directly.'

You will get some problem questions sometimes, and here's how to handle them:

* The Long Rambling Question Without A Point. The audience will be slowly dying inside. They will love you if you help wrap it up. Move nearer towards the questioner, look friendly, put your palm up towards them to show you want them to pause for you to speak, and just speak over them anyway. At first say *"Can I ask you to make the question brief please? We have limited time."* If this doesn't work say *"It sounds like you have a lot of points you'd like to cover, but we're pushed for time, so why not come up and see me at the end, I'd love to chat then. Let's move on, who has the next question?"*. You are the one on stage, you have the authority in the room. Use it confidently, but kindly.
* The Question That Does Not Contain A Question. Again, the audience will be a little exasperated, so will be very grateful if you keep things on track. Interrupt and ask the questioner if they actually have a question to put to you, and remind them that time is tight. And feel free to again suggest they come up at the end, and then you can move on.
* The Persistant Interrogator. Sometimes the person asking the question will be a cynic, a devil's advocate or just a pain. They will ask a question, but will never be happy with your response unless you agree with them, and will want to keep questioning and challenging. You can't win. After responding to their first question or point, simply be firm and polite when they try to come back in - "We're pressed for time and I want to involve as many people as possible. But I'll be around at the end if you'd like to chat more".

The key is in all cases to be frienldy and polite, but to take on the authority and presence of being the speaker on the stage. The audience is relying on you for that, and they have placed themselves in your hands.

There are also some techniques you can use to open up the Q&A into a more interesting dialogue, engaging people that otherwise may not have put their hands up. If questions are slow, or if an interesting topic comes up you think could be explored, then feel free to pose questions back to the audience - "Well, dealing with China is an interesting topic - has anyone in the room launched a site targetted at the Chinese market?" for example. Some will put their hands up, and you can ask for their experiences, and if that presents any questions they would like to ask. Even if nobody puts their hands up that's a topic for discussion - approach a friendly face and ask "What has put you off dealing with the Chinese market?" and so on.


# Summary

Anyone can be a great presenter. You don't need to be the loudest, most conident person. You don't need to be a natural entertainer. You don't need to be the best in your field.

They key is in finding your voice, your style, and in preparing your message and your delivery well.

Then, give a lot of presentations, and learn from every single one.
