<h3>Phone Directory</h3>
The phone directory listing direct external and internal numbers can be found in the <a href=http://way.wunder.co.uk/who/wr-phone-directory/> Wunderroot telephone directory</a>

<h3>Phone Calls</h3>
Each member of staff is provided with a SIP phone. The MD and Operations Manager are part of a hunt group that is responsible for taking external calls. Calls are filtered, messages taken and passed on if necessary. Traditional phone calls rarely take place on the phone with Google Hangouts being the preferred method.

We subscribe to the PureJam telephony service which answers our calls when nobody is available on the hunt group. The PureJam service takes messages and passes on caller information to Steve Hunton and Steve Parks where necessary. PureJam take only enough information to pass on the contact to the correct person and do not record sensitive information.

Personal information about staff is never given out over the phone.

Calls (SIP, mobile, softphone, online application) involving sensitive information should be carried out in a private area such as a meeting room to prevent information being overheard.

<h3>Video Conferencing</h3>
Video tools such as Google Hangouts are mostly used for project communication. As with any phone calls, personal information should not be given out without the express permission of the individual. Sensitive project or customer information should not be discussed unless the call is being held is a private area such as a meeting room.
