Wunderroot’s information comprises valuable assets that always need to be appropriately protected. The object of information security is to protect these assets from a wide range of threats in order to ensure service continuity, to minimise damage to Wunderroot and to maximise our performance for the well-being of all stakeholders.

Wunderroot’s management supports the requirements of information security management and will provide the means to ensure that our information is appropriately and adequately protected using an Information Security Management System (ISMS) which will be subject to regular reviews in order to identify continuous improvement. Information security objectives include, but are not limited to:

* Preserving the confidentiality of information
* Ensuring that any information received from other sources, produced by Wunderroot
* Making all information available when required
* Applying appropriate and effective security controls
* Ensuring compliance with legislative and contractual requirements
* Providing information security training to all staff
* Detecting viruses and malicious software
* Undertaking business continuity management, considering security, to protect Wunderroot against major failures and disasters
* Reporting and investigating all breaches of information security whether actual or suspected

The Security Manager is responsible for facilitating the policy and providing advice and guidance on its implementation. However, all managers are responsible for communicating and implementing relevant security policies and procedures within their areas and all staff are responsible for being aware of these policies are reporting any suspected or actual non-compliance. Information security is the responsibility of all within Wunderroot.

This policy will be reviewed annually, as a minimum, or following a major change to the organisation.
