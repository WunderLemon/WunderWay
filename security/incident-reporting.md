This document has been created to describe procedures for identifying, reporting and responding to and any learning that can come of the loss of information or information systems such as laptops, USBs and hard copy files / documents.

The primary objective of this Security Incident Reporting and Management is to detect, investigate and resolve any actual, suspected or potential breaches of information security, and to take action that will avoid, or reduce the impact or probability of a further similar such events in the future.


## 1. Purpose
1.1. This document has been constructed to describe the procedure to identify, report,
respond to, and any learning obtained from loss of information and information systems e.g. laptops, USBs and hard copy files / documents.

## 2. Scope
2.1. This process can be applied to all aspects of Wunderroot’s operations whether electronic, non-electronic, personnel, premises or infrastructure

## 3. Overview
3.1. Formal incident recording and escalation will be implemented for all systems and activities.

3.2.  Unusual events will be recorded as incidents including what happened, what was done and the result.

3.3. The objective of Security Incident Reporting and Management is to detect, investigate and resolve any actual, suspected or potential breaches of information security, and to take
action that will avoid, or reduce the impact or probability of a further similar recurrence.

3.4. An incident is anything that is considered to have the potential to cause:
    loss of system or information availability 
           disclosure of confidential information, whether electronic or paper, or any  
other form including conversation
    corruption of information
    disruption of activity
    financial loss
    legal action.

3.5. Incidents could include:
    unauthorised use of a system for the processing or storage of data
    loss of removable media (USB Stick, Disc etc) and portable equipment
(Laptops/Table, PCs)
    loss of paper files containing sensitive data.

3.6; The following should be established as rapidly as possible:
when the incident occurred;
when the incident was discovered
details of the person reporting the incident;
whether a near miss or an actual incident;
what data and data media is involved;
who is involved (e.g.individuals, offices, teams);
where the incident occurred;
the sensitivity of the data and if personal data, the number of persons involved;
whether the information and/or media was protectively marked and if so at what
level;
who is aware of the incident;
whether and how the data might be used by a third party;
the Information Asset Owner for the information involved;
the immediate cause of the information loss e.g. breach, theft, misplaced,
destroyed;
the location of the information at the point of loss e.g. in the post, with a courier, in
a home office;

### If in the post
How was it sent?
Was it double enveloped?
Was the address verified?
Where was it sent from?

### If with a courier
From where was it collected?
Was it sent with “track and trace”?
Was it collected by the expected courier?
Was the address verified?
Was it double enveloped?

### If from a home office?
From where was it accessed/stole? (e.g. terminal, public areas,
desk, drawer, filing cabinet, office)
Was it protectively marked?
If it was protectively marked, was it stored appropriately?
The crime number if the incident has been reported to the RMP/Police.

3.7. Each employee has a personal responsibility for making sure that no breaches of security arise as a result of their actions, however everyone must be made aware of their responsibility for the reporting of any potential, suspected or actual incidents such as (security threats?), data loss, vulnerabilities, breaches, software or system failures to the IAO.

3.8. Any knowingly caused breaches in security dues to reckless behaviour or non compliance with policies regarding security or the none reporting of an incident may result in disciplinary action.

## 4. Responsibilities
4.1. Users
Complete a Security Incident Report Form and report any incidents promptly to the Chief information officer to provide further information or evidence when requested.

4.2. Information Asset Officer (IAO)
On request the Information Asset officer should disseminate blank Security Incident Report Forms and log and allocate reference for those forms that have been completed. 

4.3. Senior information risk owner (SIRO)
Allocate severity and priority to any incidents that have arisen and agree to a resolution action plan and maintain both Incident Report Progress Record (spreadsheets) and a library of completed records
Resolution advice should also be monitored and provide information to other parties if possible. To reduce the possibility and frequency of recurrence the SIRO should also review resolved incidents and manage activities to limit potential impact of future incidents.

4.4. Information Technology security officer (ITSO) and Head of Information architecture (IA)
Will work closely with the SIRO to find the root of the cause of the incident and identify potential changes that can be implemented to avoid the risk arising again.

## 5. Procedure
5.1. Below, procedure is described as closely as possible however the varying nature of incidents means that common sense should be applied to maintain the correct handling of each case according to its severity.

5.2. Urgency may be required to reduce the potential impact of the incident henceforth there may be times when the incident has been resolved before it has been recorded. When this occurs a report form should be completed as soon as possible.

5.3. All incidents no matter how minor should be recorded in the style of the following procedure to reduce the likelihood of an incident recurrence.

5.4. Recording
Every reported incident will be recorded on a Security Incident report form (see Appendix A). IAO will allocate a Reference Number and record the details on the Incident
Report Progress Record SIRO will keep the records up to date as resolution progresses

5.5. Resolution
Incidents once reported will be prioritised according to their severity this will be based on the impact this has on the relevant systems and each case will be categorized as:
Critical (C)
High (H)
Medium (M)
Low (L)

Resolution of the incident will be allocated to an individual or team, and an action plan will
be produced with target resolution times. The resources used to resolve the incident will
depend upon the identified severity level. For example, in the case of a Low severity “no
action” may be an acceptable option if the resources required outweigh the impact.

5.6. Escalation
Every security incident that may have an impact on customers or staff will be
reported immediately to the SIRO and the Managing Director. On resolution of the incident, actions taken will be recorded on the Security Incident Report Form.

5.7. Any incident involving actual or possible losses of personal data must be reported to the Information Commissioners Officer (ICO), Cabinet Office’s, Government Security Secretariat (GSS) should also be notified. Local Authorities should report incidents to their Warning Advice and Reporting Point (WARP).

5.8. All network security incidents will be reported to GovCERT, and CINRAS for CESG approved cryptographic incidents respectively by the Chief Information Officer.

5.9. Any incidents that are deemed to be criminal will immediately be reported to the police by either the IAO or the SIRO to obtain a crime number, this crime number will be documented with the incident report.

5.10. Review and Learning
All resolved incidents will be reviewed to ascertain whether there is a risk of reoccurrence.
If there is no such risk the incident record will be closed. All potential vulnerabilities will be
assessed, and appropriate action taken to ensure that the risk is kept to an acceptable level, implementing such controls as may be necessary, where appropriate risk registers will be updated.

5.11. Closure
Each incident will remain open until it has been satisfactorily resolved, documentation
completed, and actions taken to avoid reoccurrence, or to ensure the impact of
recurrence is at an acceptable level. Closure will be approved by the Chief information officer, usually with a peer review.
