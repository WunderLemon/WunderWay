We have a simple global document management structure at Google Drive. Everybody in the company has read access to everything by default, write access is a bit more limited to help avoid those whoops moments with Drive sync.

- The root folder: https://drive.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/folderview?id=0B37ZN897nVLhfmNSVldjZWNhUTgtTjA0NEdCTzZZTTNvdzJHX1l6MFNKWmZseWg3RUpuRzg&usp=sharing
- Spreadsheet explaining the entire structure, naming conventions, etc: https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/spreadsheets/d/1Avreespd0lOEbVycOzyBnRAdl2lujEGzqz3E5IWM56U/edit?usp=sharing

Please note that the documentation structure for customer projects is part of our ISO certified quality system.
