title: Pyramid of Communication
---
We have plenty of channels, how to communicate with peers and customers. The _Pyramid of Communication_ provides a guideline, when to use which channel based on the urgency of the topic to address.

This list is ordered descendingly from urgent & synchronous to informative & asynchronous:

1. Face-to-face 
2. Traditional Voice Call (Mobile / Landline)
3. Video Call: Skype / “VOIP” 
4. Directed Chat (1:1, small group chat)
5. Groupchat 
	* Directed @someone
	* Directed @all / @here
6. Issue, Ticketing or Project Management Application
7. EMail 

## Choose your channel
The choice of with channel is most appropriate depends on the purpose of the conversation, as well as on the surrounding conditions.

### Types of conversations/purpose and the communication channels
Typical types and purposes of conversations, and their appropriate channel:

1. Informing: asynchronous (EMail)
2. Updating (Tasks and status updates on them): asynchronous (Ticketing system)
3. Escalating: synchronous (at least call), supported by email for documenation purposes
4. Exploring: synchronous (video call, workshop, face-to-face)
5. Inspiring: synchronous (video call, face-to-face)
6. Advising (Feedback): synchronous (video call, face-to-face)
7. Chatting: both

### Surrounding conditions
There are multiple aspects to consider, whether to choose a synchronous or an asynchronous channel of communication:

#### Urgency
Question: do I need the other person act right now?

#### Availability
Question: is the other person available right now, within a suitable time slot and do I want to interrupt the person's workflow?

#### Documentation / Persistence
Question: do I need written approval of something? Do I want to document the issue at hand?

#### Actionable
Question: is what I want actionable without further explanation or is it explorative and will require some clarifications?

#### Privacy
Question: do I need to communicate something intagible, delicate, sensitive, group dynamics, personal important etc.?

## We are remote, we are documented
Keep always in mind that Wunderkraut is operating in a highly remote setup. This implies that your peers and you will benefit from well documented and accessible communication.
Thus, regardless of the communication channel: document, document, document - or along the line of scientist: publish or perish!
