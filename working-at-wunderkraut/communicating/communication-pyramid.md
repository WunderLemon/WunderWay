## Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
As a rule of thumb, we adhere to the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, which states - besides others - “Individuals and interactions over processes and tools”. 
In most of our projects, we have to consider the highly remote setup. Within these circumstances, interactions between individuals are not always to be considere (and efficient) to be face-to-face. According to this, in order to discuss issues and reach mutual agreement, we prefer the following communication channels in their given order:

1. Persistent documentation system (Ticket / Issue system, CRM, etc.)
2. Call (Skype/HipChat, phone, VOIP)
3. In person conversation

If not documented by the nature of the communication channel, any relevant results of discussions must then be documented within an appropriate, persistent system.

## Avoid Email
We avoid emails internally completely, because we want to ensure that every decision is documented in a central place, which is accessible to everyone (e.g. Ticket/Issue System, GoogleDrive, Wiki).
If we exchange information with third parties by email, relevant outcomes have to be documented and provided to the team.

### Further rationale on the use of emails
Every conversation usually ends in one of the two following results:

1. Define clear tasks
2. Agree or communicate decisions

Both results should be documented in a central place and as close to the issues, which they have an influence on (e.g. for projects: Epics, User Stories; in sales: Deals). Emails are the least efficient way to document decisions, because they are either

- only available to a closed group or
- decisions are not made public or
- discussions are tedious to be organized or
- parties, which join at a later stage have difficulties in reading through all forwarded and replied emails or
- too many people get cc’ed and hence ignore any communication anyways.

## Pyramid of Communication
We have plenty of channels, how to communicate with peers and customers. The _Pyramid of Communication_ provides a guideline, when to use which channel based on the urgency of the topic to address.

This list is ordered descendingly from urgent & synchronous to informative & asynchronous:

1. Face-to-face 
2. Traditional Voice [Mobile / Landline]
3. Skype / “VOIP” 
4. Directed Chat (1:1, small group chat)
5. Groupchat 
	* Directed @someone
	* Directed @all / @here
6. EMail 

### Synchron vs. Asynchron
There are three dimensions fo decide, whether to choose a synchronous or an asynchronous channel of communication:

#### Urgency
Do I need feedback now? 
The more time critical my request is, the more synchronous needs to be the channel of communication.

#### Focus
Is what I want actionable / explorative?
**TODO**

#### Empathy
Do I need to communicate something intagible, sensitive, explorative, group dynamics, important etc.?
**TODO**

## Commitment

* If I address a person, I will expect an answer.
* If I’ve asked for something, I confirm that I’ve read the answer and confirm that this helped/resolved my issue.
* If I’ve asked for something and things/circumstances change, I will send a notfication ASAP.
