The use of laptop/notebook computers increases the risks associated with the secure storage of data. The purpose of this policy is to set out the criteria for the provision of laptop/notebook computers and the conditions relating to their use.
This document forms part of Wunderkraut’s ISO 27001 Information Security Management System.

This policy is applicable to all staff, contractors and volunteers working within Wunderkraut.

## Responsibility

### Users

Laptops/notebooks and media must be handled and stored securely. In cars they must be stored out of sight when the car is left unattended e.g. in boot.
When users are travelling, laptops/notebooks (and media) should not be left unattended in public places and should always be carried as hand luggage when travelling by public transport.
Unofficial, unauthorised or unlicensed software must not be loaded on laptops/notebooks.

### Wunderkraut

Wunderkraut should ensure the correct configuration of the laptop/notebooks i.e. hard drives are encrypted to 256 bit, Data Loss Protection (DLP) software is installed and all relevant group policies are enforced. All laptops must be password protected with a password over 16 characters long containing both Alphanumeric characters and punctuation.

Wunderkraut must approve and recommend a member of staff to be given remote access, having regard to the role and remit of the member of staff.

Wunderkraut must ensure that when an employee leaves their remote access rights are removed and the laptop returned to Wunderkraut.

### Operational system

Wunderkraut will consider the provision of a laptop/notebook computer if the following criteria are met:

* a member of staff is required to work from more than one location and convenient access to a desktop PC is not available in all the locations;
* a member of staff regularly undertakes work at home on behalf of Wunderkraut, provided that such work does not breach the Working Times Directive;

Requests for laptop/notebook computers must be peer reviewed, with the management completing the purchase.

This policy must be read in conjunction with Wunderkraut’s Home Working Policy.

### Provision of Laptop/Notebook Computers

The provision of Wunderkraut laptop/notebook computers shall be subject to the following conditions:

### Person Identifiable Information

In order to comply with the Data Protection Act, person identifiable information shall be stored in a laptop/notebook only when this is absolutely necessary. Where it is necessary to store such information, the following conditions apply:

* Unnecessary user accounts (e.g. Guest accounts and unnecessary administrative accounts) should be removed or disabled.
* Unnecessary software (including application, system utilities and network services) should be removed or disabled.
* The auto-run feature should be disabled (to prevent software programs running automatically when removable storage media is connected to a computer or when network folders are accessed).
* A personal firewall (or equivalent) should be enabled on desktop PCs and laptops,and configured to disable (block) unapproved connections by default.
* Password authentication must be applied;
encryption must be applied to the hard drive;
* It shall be stored only for the time period when it is actively being used;
* It shall be deleted immediately after use;
* Only the minimum amount of person identifiable information, necessary for the current purpose, shall be stored;
* The person’s name shall be stored only when absolutely necessary;
* Measures shall be taken to maximise the physical security of the laptop/notebook computer;
* For work involving person identifiable information from locations within Wunderkraut, users will be required, wherever possible, to use the Wunderkraut’s network to store data.
* Public wifi should not be used to transfer sensitive data, if public wifi is unavoidable, the Wunderkraut VPN should be used.

Wunderkraut laptops/notebooks are provided for business use only.

### Backups

It is not permissible for Wunderkraut data to be stored solely on the hard disk of a laptop or notebook. Users of Wunderkraut laptops/notebooks are responsible for ensuring that all Wunderkraut data used on the laptops/notebooks is backed up. Common practice is for data to be stored on network or shared drives as these are backed centrally.

### Wunderkraut’s Right to Inspect Data

All data and software held on Wunderkraut laptops/notebooks may be inspected by authorised staff at any time and without warning.  Users may be required to remove software and/or data which are deemed to be inappropriate.

### Software maintenance

As Wunderkraut predominantly use Apple Mac computers it is priority to outline maintaining security on OSX. Periodically, Apple releases free updates for OSX software. Updates should be set to run automatically. These include important security updates that protect Apple computers from potential threats.

Any patches that are released for threats should be implemented immediately. It is the responsibility of Wunderkraut employees to observe changes in technology and maintain their computers to prevent risk.

Updates suggested by other software vendors used for products used by Wunderkraut should also be implemented.

### Hardware faults

Any hardware faults are to be monitored by the Wunderkraut user and reported to the Wunderkraut management. All Apple products are covered by Applecare and can be fixed under the policies outlined by Apple.  Replacement items can be requested using the peer review outlined in the Wunderkraut hardware and software purchasing documents.

### Laptop Insurance

All Wunderkraut hardware is insured both within the UK and abroad.

### Disposal of Wunderoot Hardware

After 2 years of use any Wunderkraut hardware will become the property of the user who requested its original purchase.
This is supported by the Wunderkraut ISMS data policy whereby no company information is kept on laptops and computers but is stored in a central location, this prevents the need to destroy company laptops.

If a user leaves the company before 2 years any hardware can be purchased from Wunderkraut for a cost that represents its current value.
