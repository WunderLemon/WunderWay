title: Hardware purchasing

The purpose of this policy is to guide Wunderkraut staff in the purchasing of Hardware and Software for company use. This document forms part of Wunderkrautâ€™s ISO 27001 Information Security Management System.

This policy is applicable to all staff

### Hardware

All staff at Wunderkraut have the ability to choose suitable hardware to be purchased specifically for their own use within the company. This is done by the process of peer review, entailing another team member to review the purchase and the reason for it to confirm that it is suitable.

Each staff member has a bi annual budget to equip themselves or their home office with items that they need to work efficiently and comfortably.

Final purchasing of the required items will be completed by either Steve Hunton or Steve Parks on behalf of Wunderkraut once the peer review has been completed.

Purchasing Apple products should be done through the Wunderkraut Apple joint venture scheme with the Covent Garden Apple Store, which provides same day support and replacement hardware when required.
