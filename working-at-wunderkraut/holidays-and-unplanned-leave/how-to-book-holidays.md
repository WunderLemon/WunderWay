title: How to Book Holidays

Holidays, we all need them occasionally. If you want to book a holiday just put the details of your request in an email to uk.team@wunder.uk or drop them into UK room in HipChat and ask one of your colleagues to peer review this. If there are no problems then send the details to Nic and she'll add this to your calendar and the holiday request log.

Your holiday allowance is listed in your contract.

If you ever need a note of your holidays, the dates taken or the days you have remaining, check this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahb4YZjQwNDgdDVsd2dhdnBDbV96dDRkYVNFYUNac1E#gid=3) or just ask one of the Steve H or Nic.
