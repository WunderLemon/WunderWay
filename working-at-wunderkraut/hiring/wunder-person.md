title: A Wunder Person
---

At Wundercamp London in August 2014 we had a session in which we tried to identify the qualities that make a good member of the Wunderteam - someone that would feel they fitted in, and that we would be happy to have. Everyone contributed ideas on post it notes, and we gathered them in groups on the wall in common themes. There was a lot of overlap (which showed what we valued most), and this is the distilled version.

These are the qualities we'll be looking for in future recruits:


### Professional

- Capable
- Methodical
- Skilled
- Reflective
- Objective
- Service Oriented
- Responsible
- Adaptable
- Industrious
- Team Player


### Entrepreneur

- Active
- Pioneering
- Reactive
- Versatile
- Innovative
- Creative
- Leader
- Has side projects
- Willing to develop


### Amazing Communication

- Great listener
- Charismatic
- Disrupter
- Keen
- Willing to challenge


### Character

- Ethical

- Grateful
- Generous
- Sense of Personal Responsibility


### Social Skillset
