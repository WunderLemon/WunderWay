All Wunderkraut staff have legal right to access information that Wunderkraut hold on them.
The Data Protection Act contains 8 principles that everyone responsible for using data has to follow.
All staff at Wunderkraut have a responsibility to comply with these principles.
Any Wunderkraut employee that feels their information has been misused or has not been kept secure has the right to contact the Information Commissioner's Office.

The Data Protection Act has been implemented with the focus of respecting the rights of individuals when processing their personal information. This is achieved using an open and honest work ethos that Wunderkraut uses to educate staff about the use of their personal information and following data handling best practises.

The act is mandatory and all organisations that hold or process personal data must comply.
The Data Protection Act contains 8 key facts:

*	personal data should be processed fairly and lawfully
*	data should be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purposes
*	the data should be adequate, relevant and not excessive
*	it should be accurate and where necessary kept up to date
*	any data should not be kept for longer than necessary
*	personal data should be processed in accordance with the individuals rights under the act
*	data should be kept secure
*	personal data should not be transferred outside the European Economic Areas unless the country offers adequate data protection.

Wunderkraut staff also have a responsibility under the Act to ensure that their activities comply with the Data Protection Principles. Line managers have responsibility for the type of personal data they collect and how they use it.

Staff should not disclose personal data outside the organisation's procedures, or use personal data held on others for their own purposes.

Workers have a legal right to access information that an employer may hold on them. This could include information regarding any grievances or disciplinary action, or information obtained through monitoring processes. Arrangements should be in place to deal with requests as a 40 day time limit is stipulated. Information can be withheld if releasing it would make it more difficult to detect crime or the information is about national security.
