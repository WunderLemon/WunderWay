title: Drupal - Workflow Management
---

Drupal handles workflow and the configuration of a bespoke workflow very smoothly. Content can be moved through various stages - create, check, edit, approve, publish - to reduce the risk of errors and provide more accurate content.

###Content Locking

As content is edited, it’s locked to that editor until they save their changes. Once the changes are saved and the editor leaves the content, other editors can then make further changes.

###Change Log

When viewing content, the workflow interface provides a log of changes made to that particular piece of content. It shows what was changed or added, who made the changes, and the time and date of the changes.

There’s also a diff option that compares a current version and a previous version of the content, displaying the two side by side, so the changes are clear.

###Audit Trail

All content changes are logged, so the workflow includes functionality to rollback to previous versions. Those changes remain in the history of the document, so it’s possible to view all of the changes to the content over time.

Workflow is also combined with roles or permissions to ensure that only those with the correct authority can carry out each step.

As content moves through its different states and is owned, it’s publishing status is displayed in multiple ways in the CMS. This makes content easier to find and manage. Editors can preview changes and revisions to content as they go, giving them a clear picture of how it will look once published.

###CMS User Homepage

When a CMS user logs in, their workflow homepage displays their own work, what they’ve worked on recently and the status of that work.

If they’re responsible for editing or publishing content then they’ll see a section with content awaiting moderation.

The user can view the history of changes made to any content. They can review the actual text changes, who made the changes and the each different status that the content was passed through.

If live content requires a change, an editable copy of the content will be created. Changes won’t appear on the site until the edits have passed through the workflow.

This removes any content downtime unless absolutely necessary. Where content needs to be taken down, it can simply be unpublished while the changes are applied and approved. This provides you with the option to continue to feature a product on your site while changes are being applied and approved. This is particularly useful when a new version or slightly different stock is expected, but older stock remains unsold.

###Multiple Customisable Workflows

Workflows within Drupal are completely customisable, and we’ll work with you to determine the best workflow for your requirements and users. Multiple workflows can be created and applied to different types of content. For example, some content might require checking for legal compliance, other content might need to be checked by the manufacturer if they have very specific requirements for displaying or describing their products.

This type of workflow ensures that everyone using the site receives the same service and that the quality of service remains high and professional.
