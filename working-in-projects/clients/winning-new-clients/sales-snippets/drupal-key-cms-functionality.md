title: Drupal - Key CMS Functionality

**Template layouts** create consistency in layout across your site, and our designers will work with you to define these layouts. Drupal provides **views** which give you the functionality to control the layout of multiple or individual pages, or elements of pages, so you can present content to the user in the most effective way, while responding to the requirements of the brands you sell.

You’ll be able to **upload files** to the CMS to display on the site or be linked to from it. Types of files can include Word, PDF, Excel, video, images and sound.

You’ll be able to view everything in the CMS and **filter content** according to which changes you need to make. It’s simple to **search content** by type, name, tags and author, whether it was created within the CMS or uploaded.

We can create **different user roles** for your CMS users, and **restrict and allow functionality**, depending on the requirements of each role. This will be combined with your **workflow** to ensure that only certain roles can perform certain tasks.

Your current need to hand-code HTML to create bespoke layouts will be replaced with functionality, including drag-and-drop, to achieve your design goals.

Drupal’s simplicity will give you freedom to focus time, money and effort on other business priorities. Most of the features you will need to manage your site’s content are already available out of the box in Drupal core. There are also 16,000 modules available for adding specific functionality quickly and easily. The benefit of this approach is that the solution is not bloated and contains only the functionality you need.

In order to extend the capabilities of your site further, Drupal also offers your site easy ways to **interact with external media and file services** using API’s and modules designed for this purpose.
