title: QMS Internal Audits & Management Reviews
---
We don't want to impose processes unless they're effective and efficient. If they are then we want to make sure they're implemented properly.

We carry out Management Reviews which look at how effective the QMS is. We also carry out Internal Audits that look at how effectively the processes have been implemented.

### Internal Audit

The Internal audit is carried out twice a year by the QMS Manager and a supporting director.

Each internal audit looks at specific areas of the QMS. We maintain a schedule - [Internal Audit Schedule](https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahb4YZjQwNDgdGFaNi1EVWh1bEU3akVacUVyR3NxVHc#gid=0)

This schedule ensures that all elements of the QMS are audited during the course of the year.

Each audit looks at how well the processes have been implemented and if not (a *non-conformity*) we look at the reasons why and how to address this.

The overall purpose of the internal audit is to make sure we're all managing projects, people and operations in the same way so that we consistently provide a great service.

If the audit identifies any issues relating to the QMS then each of these should be raised as a QMS Change Request.

### Management Review

The management reviews are carried out at least every 6 months (see [Management Review Schedule](https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahb4YZjQwNDgdDY1VURkSVBfejJNMlBPbVU3WVl0YVE#gid=0)). The purpose of the management review is to look at the results of Internal Audits, Corrective and Preventive actions, the quality policy, the control of non-conforming products and customer satisfaction to see whether the QMS is providing the inputs to achieve the quality objectives.

If the management review identifies any issues relating to the QMS then each of these will be raised as a change request by adding the details as a story to [Rally > Wunderroot > QMS > backlog](https://rally1.rallydev.com/#/18084711157d/backlog).
