Every day there is a daily call, hangout or meeting (timeboxed to 15 minutes) during which time each member of The Team discusses:

“Yesterday I...”
“Today I will...”
“My blockers are...”

This is an opportunity to report progress, report what is planned and to raise any issues.

Each member of the team takes their turn. Other people can attend the meeting but only the team should participate. It's important to maintain this rule in order to keep to the 15 minute timebox. If there are issues that need further discussion then they should be covered in a separate call or meeting.
