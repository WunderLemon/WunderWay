One of our objectives is to be more efficient when winning business and driving down the costs. The first step in achieving this is recording the cost to win each project.

We record the costs in our [Cost of Tender spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahb4YZjQwNDgdGlNeVc4djhRVUd0d0lTYjBSTDJJS3c#gid=0). This is later reviewed during the Management Reviews.
