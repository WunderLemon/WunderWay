title: Is this a suitable project?
---

We don't want to pursue a client or project unless it's the right fit for us. Each project is assessed to make sure it's suitable. This is carried out by two people using our [Project Evaluation spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahb4YZjQwNDgdDZpdWVxQmxLQ2dibkxocUduaTZoRkE#gid=0) and saved in the *Reviews & Assessments* folder in the project repository (as “Client Name - Project Evaluation”).

If the project looks like a good fit then we create a project repository in Google Drive:

- Go to the WunderRoot Client Projects folder
- Check the ! Repository TEMPLATE folder
- Click the More option at the top of the menu and select Download from the options
- Now, click to create a new folder and use the client name as the title
- Click and drag the downloaded folders into the new client folder (select the option to convert documents to Google documents)
