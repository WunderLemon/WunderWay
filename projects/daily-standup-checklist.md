---

The Daily Standup is timeboxed to a maximum of 15 minutes

Following is the standard procedure for all daily project standups:

* The Scrum Master (SM) announces the attendees
* Randomly the SM selects each member of the team to answer the following questions:
* * Yeseterday I...
* * Today I will...
* * My blockers are...
* Once all members of the team have ran through their scrum notes the SM runs through all of the open risks, issues and dependencies
* If any blockers are raised, identify who will be required to address them and advise that theyâ€™ll be picked up after the scrum.
* If there are any meetings or any advisories for that day, announce them now.
* Thank everyone for attending and announce the date and time of the next meeting.
