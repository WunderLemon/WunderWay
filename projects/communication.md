When setting up a project it's essential that everyone involved in the project is able to communicate effectively.

###Text chat

Our primary tool for this is [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/). Each project is set up with its own room. We also have a WunderCafe room for general chat. Every room is also supported by the all-seeing, all-knowing Cato. We'll introduce the two of you later.

HipChat can also be used for voice and video calls.

###Voice chat

Sometimes it's good to talk. We use SIP phones (with support from our own receptionist) and also use [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/) and [Google Hangouts](http://www.google.com/intl/ALL_uk/+/learnmore/hangouts/).

###Video chat

Being a distributed bunch it's sometimes good to see a friendly face. When people are unable to attend meetings in person we'll often dial them in via video and sit them at the desk with us so they still feel part of the meeting.

Again, we use [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/) and [Google Hangouts](http://www.google.com/intl/ALL_uk/+/learnmore/hangouts/). Skype is not quite so common now due to the technical problems we've had in the past.

However you decide to communicate, regular communication is the key to being successful. Keep the dialogue going, don't let things go unsaid. If there's a project issue or a personal problem be sure to communicate. A problem shared...
