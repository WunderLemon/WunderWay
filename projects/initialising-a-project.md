## Contacts

Contacts are made in a number of ways:

* Research - we actively seek the details of particular clients
* Contacts - made via conference and meetings
* Referrals - direct contact via the website, phone and email
* G-Cloud - the government’s procurement service

After the initial contact, if we’re likely to pursue the client then their contact details will be entered into our CRM, <a href="https://app.pipedrive.com/pipeline/1/user/everyone">Pipedrive</a>. 

## Assessing Project Suitability

In order to make an assessment of a project’s suitability we use a homegrown tool that helps us make decisions based primarily on gut feelings. This is based on our knowledge of the client, experience of similar projects and helps us make the decision whether or not to continue with the project.

The WR Project Evaluation spreadsheet template:

<https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahb4YZjQwNDgdFpOd3o3bHBkYXQ2eGV1X2diM2ZxVGc#gid=0>

If the project looks like a good fit then we create a project repository in Google Drive:

* Go to the WunderRoot Client Projects folder
* Check the ! Repository TEMPLATE folder
* Click the More option at the top of the menu and select Download from the options
* Now, click to create a new folder and use the client name as the title
* Click and drag the downloaded folders into the new client folder (select the option to convert documents to Google documents)

The WR Project Evaluation is then stored in the Reviews & Assessments folder using the naming convention:
“Client Name - Project Evaluation - Month Year”.

Any paperwork required or received by the project will then be filed in the Google Drive project repository for the client. 

## Cost of Acquisition

In order to assess our efficiency we record the times spent seeking new business. 

WR Cost of Tender:

These costs, and the data gathering method will be assessed during the management review.

## Initial Requirements, Response and Contracts

The initial contact with the client, whether through a series of meetings or through a formal tender process will result in the production of a proposal or a tender response document.

Not all projects are the same but we still need to maintain records of proposals, project initiation documents, tender responses and contracts. All of these will be stored in the client’s Google Drive “Contracts” and “Technical Documentation” folders.

This early stage, through the gathering of requirements and objectives will help us to establish a clear picture of what the client needs, the values we need to deliver and how we’ll deliver.

Prior to the project initiation the contract is written and is signed by the client. The signing of contracts is done digitally using our DocuSign account. DocuSign delivers the contract to a specified email address, collects the signature and stores the signed document. All steps - sent, received, signed - they’re all logged so that we know the status of the contract. Note, this has been operational only since 15 May 2013.

When details of the work are agreed they will be written up as a Statement of Work and stored in the Contracts folder. 

## Tenders

Writing tender documents is a big commitment on time and resources. Choosing to pursue an unsuitable project is costly and takes resource away from other tasks.

When receiving an invitation to tender (ITT) we make an initial assessment of the tender to determine whether or not we should pursue using our Project Evaluation spreadsheet.

Unless the client dictates the form of the response we use our own proposal template with pre-written and pre-approved content to create the majority of the proposal. This enforces consistency and assures quality. It also reduces the time required to produce the proposal.

When preparing the proposal or attending meetings to discuss the project we record our times in order that we can determine the effects of changes in our approach to these.

Pre-written content is reviewed every six months by our copywriter. Details of this are recorded in the Contents Schedule. Requests for new content are added to the QMS Change Request log.

## Monitoring Project Costs

All expenses (receipts and details) relating to a project should be emailed to uk.finance@wunderroot.com. 

Staff on projects are billed per day. The Scrummaster or Project Director are responsible for recording this information which is then invoiced through our accounting service <a href="https://go.xero.com/Dashboard/">Xero</a>.

<a href="https://go.xero.com/Dashboard/">Xero</a> can provide various reports. If the reports are unavailable then email Ed at uk.finance@wunderroot.com with your report requirements.
