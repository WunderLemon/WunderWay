title: Issue & Risk Management
---

Every project includes registers to record details of risks, issues and dependencies.

The management of issues and risks is key to the success of our projects. We're very transparent in the management of risks and share the management and progress of these openly with the client. Sharing decisions on risk management allows us to use the skills and experience of a wider team.

These will be reviewed weekly (as a minimum) by the Product Owner and the Scrum Master.

The registers will be stored in Google Drive under the Issues & Risks folder.

We illustrate and discuss the management and progress of risks in each steering group meeting. This provides further transparency and gains the input of a wider audience in the management of these risks.

Often there is a lot of value behind the risks that we face. By identifying the risks, understanding how to manage them down to an acceptable risk level, we can often deliver requirements that would have otherwise have been avoided or that would have failed due to a lack of proper risk management.
