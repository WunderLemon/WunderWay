title: A Reference for Newbies and WunderVeterans
---

Whether you're new to Wunder or a seasoned veteran it's unlikely that you'll know or remember everything. Here's a quick reference to point you in the right direction.

If there is anything missing from this list that would help others, please add it yourself or send a brief email to SteveH. See [How to edit WunderWay](/how/how-edit-wunderway/)


## Your first day

We’ll arrange for you to meet with your buddy for at least your first day. You’ll most likely work from The Hub, get yourself setup with equipment and access to whatever you need and get introduced to the rest of the [WunderTeam](/the-team/).

*Your buddy*

You’ll be assigned a buddy and he/she will introduce themselves shortly after we confirm your position. Your buddy is there to help you settle in, to answer your questions, to put you in touch with the rest of the team. Make sure you pay attention - you’ll be assigned as a buddy shortly!

*Your buddy checklist*

* Hipchat installed and explained
* Google Account setup
* Email setup
* Google Drive explained
* Google Hangouts, remote meetings
* Rally account setup and explained
* Harvest account setup and explained
* WunderWay explained
* Profile setup on website
* Website account setup (for blogging)

*Your mentor*

We all have a mentor too. Sometimes your buddy is not someone you work closely with. A mentor is someone more closely related to the work you do. Your mentor is there to help you develop yourself, to help unpick technical problems or to help steer you in the right direction with new processes or approaches to work.


## Head office

Although we’re all based at our home offices we do have an office. It’s a shared workspace that is a nice place to work in. We can book meeting rooms there and we can use it as an opportunity to work together sometimes too.

It’s just round the corner from Kings Cross. Easy to reach by tube, train, plane and car.

## About Wunder

If you need a reminder about who we are and what we're all about then take a look at [About Wunder](http://way.wunder.co.uk/how/about/)

How we work says a lot about who we are and what we're trying to be. We've set ourselves some objectives and we've put in place a way to manage the quality of everything we do and everything we produce. You can find out lots more in [Our Company](http://way.wunder.co.uk/company/)


## Payroll and payday

Shortly after starting our accountant, Ed, will be in touch to get you onto the payroll. We all get paid on 15th of each month.


## Expenses

All reasonable expenses incurred as part of your job will be reimbursed each week. All you have to do is send a copy of each receipt (scanned, photographed) to **uk.finance@** together with a note about which project the expense relates to and Ed will do the rest. If you need your expenses paid sooner then give one of the Steve's a nudge and they’ll help you with that.

Reasonable expenses include travel to client sites, hotels, lunch and evening meals while you’re working away.

Note: fast cars are not a company expense! <i>(Damn. SP)</i>


## Laptops and other equipment

We’ll arrange the order of your standard mobile office equipment. This includes a laptop, an external speaker and a 4G dongle. We’ll also order you a SIP phone for your home office. If you have your own laptop that you’d prefer to use then that’s fine with us. If you’d like us to order you a laptop then we can organise that and have it ready for you joining us.

Whenever you require any hardware or home office equipment we have a simple process for this. In HipChat or on email explain to the team the details of what you want and the cost and it’ll get peer reviewed. We’re all sensible adults here and all have the company’s best interests at heart so we only order those things we need. Once you have a peer review then email the details to SteveH and Nicola who will place the order for you.

See [How to buy a computer](/how/how-buy-computer/) for more information

Setting up the SIP phone needs a little more explanation. See [Gigaphone Setup] (/how/sip-phone-setup/)


## Holidays

We all need a break from time to time. When you start you’ll be allocated 25 days annual leave. Our holiday period runs from 1st January. We close the office between Christmas and New Year so you’ll need to save a few days for that.

To request holiday, get the dates peer reviewed then send an email to Nic who’ll record the days in your company calendar and our holiday log.


## Sickness and unplanned leave

If you wake up with the lurgy please inform SteveH and someone on your project as soon as possible.

If you have a sick note from the doctor please send a copy to: Wunder, The Hub, 34b York Way, London, N1 9AB and drop The Steve's an email to let us know you've done that.

If you're off sick for 4 more days in a row you'll need to complete a [self certification form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-sick-pay-employees-statement-of-sickness-sc2). For longer term sickness of 7 or more consecutive days (including non-working days) then we'll need you to provide us with a doctor's note to say you're returning to work fit and healthy or a doctor's note to say you'll be off for longer.

Similarly, if you require time off for personal reasons (childcare, compassionate leave, long term sickness) them please speak to either of the Steve’s in confidence.


## Training and events

Training and conferences help you in your personal development and they help the company too by increasing the knowledge and professionalism of our team. If there are any events you’d like to attend then get them peer reviewed. If they directly relate to your job they’ll be expensable. If it’s not a direct benefit but something for your personal development we’ll be likely to still make a contribution.

*Keeping a log of our training and events*

Attendance at any event needs to be tracked in the [Staff Training & Conference Log](https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/spreadsheets/d/1A8WHrOFKOOa_Ig0GGnf5Wt1p8YE3wlWuJid0HO_UkfI/edit#gid=2)

*Reviewing attended events*

So that we can evaluate similar events and training in future, we write a short review and recommendation on the [Events Review](https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/spreadsheets/d/18M5tBUaQEBJfinSvM8oYtBPfDOSeHxE0mVsNxXWzN0c/edit#gid=252936002) document. This way, if an event is excellent, we know and remember that we'll want to attend the next edition.

After getting it peer reviewed, send the details to SteveH and Nicola to book on the company card, or book it yourself and claim the cost back through expenses.


## Booking travel and accommodation

If you need to travel you can either book it yourself and claim back the cost through expenses or you can email Nic the details and she’ll organise the booking and the payment for you.


## Are you sitting comfortably?

It’s important that we all have a proper home office setup at home. We expect you to know what a sensible setup is. We all have different setups so it’s worth speaking to the team if you want any advice. A number of us have standing desks at home, others have stuck with the traditional desk and chair arrangement. We’re at work for long periods of the day so it’s worth being comfortable. If you need home office equipment then get it peer reviewed.

There’s also no reason why you can’t make the most of remote working and move around a little. You can work from the garden, from a coffee shop or take yourself off to a Hub for the day. Sometimes, a change is as good as a rest.

We like to share ideas for our home offices here [Comfortable Working](/how/work-comfortably/)


## Personal development

Personal development is good for us all. Most people are pretty ambitious and we’re keen to help you achieve those ambitions. Whether you’re looking to build on existing skills, develop new skills or become the next chief executive we’ll put in place a plan to help you achieve that. It is also okay that one day your career may take you away from our company. That’s not a taboo subject. We’d be immensely proud if you ended up launching your own business, and still quite pleased if you just became the new Google CEO. The key is that your time at Wunder should be a time to really develop yourself and your professional skills, and a time that you and the company both view as having been a really worthwhile collaboration.

SteveH will speak with you once you’re through your probationary period to speak with you about your wants, needs and objectives and how we can put in place a plan that fits with your work


## Fridays

Fridays are special days. Each Friday we have a company Hangout, to catch up with other staff that we haven't worked with during the week, to hear what people have been working on and what their 'give back' Friday plans are. Your first Friday Hangout will be a chance to introduce yourself and meet anyone you haven't said hello to yet.



## Documents

We use a variety of documents and tools in the course of our work and our general operations. There is a quick reference guide at [Documents and Records](http://way.wunder.co.uk/how/documents-reference/)


## Grievance

We’re all pretty collaborative and most things can be worked out with a frank and open conversation. In the event that you have a grievance that you cannot resolve yourself please speak with one of the Steves. We’ll work this out with you.


## Home bills and broadband

We pay our staff well and factor in the cost of home working expenses into our salaries. Expenses such as gas, electric and broadband are necessary but can not be expensed. (This is actually for your benefit as the tax position becomes really complicated if we try to separate this stuff out from the salary, and you’d have to fill in extra forms, but still pay the same tax).
