title: Training and events budget
---

Events and training allowance work a little different than [the equipment budget](equipmenthow-buy-computer.md). Instead of an annual/bi-annual budget, a simple peer review system is in place, if there's an event you think you should go, just ask a colleague for their approval. Additionally, if an event happens mid week and might affect the project you're on at the time, is good to check with your teammates so it can be planned and doesn't cause too much disruption.

## Log attendance

Attendance during working days needs to be tracked in the [Staff Training & Conference Log](https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahb4YZjQwNDgdHBoMWx2ZFZtTXI3T1ZlZUV3ZEdZUkE#gid=1)

## Reviewing attended events

In order to evaluate future events to attend, we add a small review and recommendation on the [Events Review](https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/spreadsheets/d/18M5tBUaQEBJfinSvM8oYtBPfDOSeHxE0mVsNxXWzN0c/edit#gid=0) document. This way, if an event is excellent, we know and remember that we'll want to attend the next edition.
