Fridays are a special day.

We only do client work Mondays to Thursdays. Fridays are reserved for working on developing our professional skills, developing our business, contributing to the communities we are part of, and other tasks that aren't client work.

##Why?
We're a professional services firm that aims to be the best at what we do, and that requires us to invest time and money in always being better. This sets aside time clearly for learning, research and development.

There are always internal meetings and tasks to do, which can get pushed down the priority list when there is client work to do, but which are important to create a good business and a great place to work.

It allows us to focus better on clients the rest of the week without the distraction of internal work.

##Examples of Friday work

- Writing blog posts or white papers
- Taking an online course
- Watching a conference video
- An internal training session (we have the Wundertalks hangout across the group on Fridays, but there could also be other one off events)
- Internal meetings
- Team weekly hangouts for catching up
- Contributing to an open source project
- Working on a pet project
- Contributing to the Wunder Way

## How it Works
Because we're self-managing, you don't need to ask what you should do on Fridays, or get permission. You do what you think is the best thing to do. But you can always ask for ideas or feedback from colleagues.

Sometimes you may be asked to help with other people's ideas or a particular company project.

At the start of the day, in your office's team chatroom, let others know what you're planning to do, if you want any help or ideas, or if you're free to collaborate with others. During the day, keep chatting about what you're up to, and at the end of the day sum up what you learned and what you achieved.

Friday work doesn't have to be a solitary activity, get together a team to work on a particular initiative, whether that's just for an hour, or the whole day.

## Client Work
When we sign up a new client we explain how Fridays work, and that we will be unavailable on those days. Most respect this, and in fact they appreciate that it means we're not secretly doing this on their time, as many other agencies do. It's part of our approach to fairness and transparency.

Occassionally it will be necessary to do some client work on a Friday because of deadlines, availability or other reasons. If this happens, communicate it clearly to colleagues and make sure you record this in the time tracker so the client is properly billed for this extra time.

## Investment
We effectively invest 20% of our potential income in the work we do on Fridays, so make it count. 

Invest the time wisely in developing yourself, the business, and the communities we are part of.
