Your buddy will spend plenty of time with you in the first few weeks with WunderRoot.

###The first day

On your first day, you'll meet up in person for the whole day, and your buddy will help you to get orientated with all the important practical stuff, like:

  - introducing you to your mentor;
  - collaborating on writing a short biography for you;
  - getting you set up for email;
  - getting access to the WunderRoot Google Drive, and understanding how to find your way around there;
  - getting set up with HipChat, and being introduced to Cato, our robot butler;
  - adding your GitHub account to any appropriate repositories;
  - introducing you to teammates on client projects;

… and so on.

You'll also have some time with your mentor or with the Managing Director to help you understand WunderRoot as a business - who we are, what we do and why we do it.

###The first week

Before you arrive at WunderRoot your buddy will have worked with your mentor and project teammates to fix up a plan for your first week. There'll plenty of things to learn about your work in those first few days, and you'll buddy will help you get you up-and-running with those things through that first week.

For at least the first week you'll have a daily Hangout with your buddy, to check how you're getting on and talk through anything that's on your mind, and you'll have plenty of similar hangouts through the first few weeks, for as long as you still feel you need them. In fact, you'll probably find that the time you spend with your buddy to begin with will mean you remain in close contact all the time you're both at WunderRoot.

One of the HipChat channels we have is specifically for asking newbie questions. Your buddy will hang out in there a lot during the first few weeks, as will your mentor and a few others in the company, so you should get the right answers your questions from someone or another pretty promptly. No question is too simple or naïve, so do be quick to ask anything you're unsure about! And questions asked in that channel will get added into the [WunderWay to help out future new starters](/how/new-starter/).

[Fridays are special days](/how/fridays/). Each Friday we have a company Hangout, to catch up with other staff that we haven't worked with during the week, to hear what people have been working on and what their 'give back' Friday plans are. Your first Friday Hangout will be a chance to introduce yourself and meet anyone you haven't said hello to yet.

###The next few weeks

As you get your bearings, your buddy will still be looking out for you and will still be there to chat to whenever you want to in the following few weeks. As you start to feel more at home in WunderRoot, though, you'll need slowly less support. Daily Hangouts will start to happen every few days, and then weekly, and as you get stuck into projects and chat with your teammates you'll find out more from them also.
