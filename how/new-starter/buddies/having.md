Your buddy will spend plenty of time with you in the first few weeks with WunderRoot.

### The first day

On your first day, you'll meet up in person for the whole day, and your buddy will help you to get orientated with all the important practical stuff, like:

  - getting you set up for email;
  - getting access to the WunderRoot Google Drive, and understanding how to find your way around there;
  - getting set up with HipChat, and being introduced to Cato, our robot butler;
  - adding your GitHub account to any appropriate repositories;
  - introducing you to teammates on client projects;
  - introducing you to your mentor;
  - collaborating on writing your short biography for the website;

… and so on.

You'll also have some time with your mentor or with the Managing Director to help you understand WunderRoot as a business - who we are, what we do and why we do it.

###The first week

Before you arrive at WunderRoot your buddy will have worked with your mentor and project teammates to develop up a plan for your first week. There'll plenty of things to learn about your work in those first few days, and your buddy will help you get you up-and-running with those things through that first week.

For the first week you'll have a daily Hangout with your buddy, to check how you're getting on and talk through anything that's on your mind. These hangouts can contine for as long as you still feel you need them.

We have a HipChat channel specifically for asking newbie questions. Your buddy will hang out in there a lot during the first few weeks, as will your mentor and a few others in the company, so you should get the right answers your questions from someone promptly. No question is too simple or naïve, so do be quick to ask anything you're unsure about! Questions asked in that channel that have no documented answer will be added into the [WunderWay to help out future new starters](/how/new-starter/).

###The next few weeks

As you get your bearings, your buddy will still be looking out for you and will still be there to chat to whenever you want to in the following few weeks. As you start to feel more at home in WunderRoot, though, you'll need slowly less support. Daily Hangouts will start to happen every few days, and then weekly, and as you get stuck into projects and chat with your teammates you'll find out more from them also.
