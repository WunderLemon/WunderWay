title: How to Book Holidays
---

Holidays, we all need them occasionally. If you want to book a holiday just drop an email to SteveP and SteveH with the dates you want to take. If there are no problems they'll confirm this and the dates will magically appear in your Google Calendar (thanks to Nic).

Your holiday allowance will be listed in your contract.

If you ever need a note of your holidays, the dates taken or the days you have remaining just ask one of the Steve's or Nic.
