As we spend a lot of time in our home offices, it's important to be comfortable, and to have a good ergonomic working position.

# Standing Desks

Many people find it's great to have a standing desk (or ultimately one that can transform between a sitting desk and a standing desk). Sitting down all day is really unhealthy so it's a great idea to stand as much as possible.

Vesa has this [adjustable height standing desk](http://www.ajproducts.co.uk/tables-desks-workstations/adjustable-standing-desks/flexus-electrically-height-adjustable-wave-desk/5138569-61474.wf) and is very pleased.

Heikki has this [fixed height standing desk](http://complete-office.co.uk/ProductDetails/Furniture/Desks/3511464/Gresham-Stand-Height-Rectangular-600Mm-Deep-1200-X-600--TS612RHZ/Master.aspx) (bought from [Whiteleys](http://www.whiteleys-office.co.uk/)). It is compact and has neutral styling but suits his needs perfectly.
